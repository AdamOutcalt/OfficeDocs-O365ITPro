When you set up your Office 365 for business subscription, you can choose to pay by using credit card or bank account payments, or to pay by invoice using check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) . Whichever method you choose, that is the payment method we will continue to use for subsequent billing periods, unless you [Change your payment method for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/8652f539-3123-4a8f-b9bd-6aa2f0e0372d).

When you pay by credit card or bank account, you'll be automatically charged for your Office 365 subscription the day after the invoice date, until the end of your subscription term. You can [Add, update, or remove a credit card or bank account in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/30ba9c83-50d8-4020-90ed-830a5b8c8724) whenever you need to.

This can happen for several reasons, including if the credit card has expired. We'll continue to retry the transaction every few days. If those attempts fail, you'll continue to receive email alerts about those failures. You can use the **Pay now** feature at any time to change your credit card information and immediately resubmit the payment.

> If you switch to a different credit card to pay the outstanding balance on your subscription, that card will be charged for all future automatic payments for that subscription.

## Pay by invoice (check or EFT)
<a name="BKMK_Invoicing"> </a>

If your Office 365 subscription costs over a certain amount of money (this amount varies by service location), you'll have the option to pay by invoice by using a check or EFT. A credit check may be required for larger invoice payments. If a credit check is required, you'll be notified when you purchase your subscription. And, if you agree to be contacted, you'll get an email that includes more information about applying for credit approval. Credit checks are usually completed within two business days.
  
If you pay by invoice for your subscription, you'll get an email that says your billing statement is ready to view. This email does not contain a copy of your billing statement. However, you can also choose to [Receive a copy of your billing statement in email](pay-for-your-subscription.md#BKMK_StatementEmail). Your billing statement includes details about your options for making a payment. If you enter a purchase order (PO) number when you buy a subscription, the number appears on your billing statement. For information about accessing billing statements, see [View your bill or invoice](https://support.office.com/article/2ae3ea58-4fce-4592-91d6-46e9ae3ec218). 
  
> [!NOTE]
> By default, your organization's billing notifications are sent to the Office 365 email address and the alternate email address of every global and billing admin in your organization. To change the alternate email address, see [Change your billing addresses for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/a25c10d6-c1e9-4299-9185-25178df9eba6). 
  
### Can I pay my bill online?

Unfortunately, if your subscription is set up to pay by invoice, we can't accept online payments directly. You can, however, [Change your payment method for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/8652f539-3123-4a8f-b9bd-6aa2f0e0372d), and the amount due will be automatically charged to your card or account after each service period. For Azure, see [How to change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=718057).
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you're switching to pay by automatic credit card payments, be sure to first pay all outstanding balances. Check your billing statement for payment options and instructions. For more information, see [Understand your invoice for Office 365 for business](understand-your-invoice.md). 
  
### Where do I send my check or EFT payment?

> [!NOTE]
> Payment by check is only available in a few countries. You can follow the payment instructions below for your country, or [check your invoice](understand-your-invoice.md). 
  
If you're not sure how much you owe, you can [View your bill or invoice](https://support.office.com/article/2ae3ea58-4fce-4592-91d6-46e9ae3ec218). For Azure, see [How to download your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=718058).
