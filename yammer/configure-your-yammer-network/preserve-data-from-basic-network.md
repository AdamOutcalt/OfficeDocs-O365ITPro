# How to preserve data from the Yammer Basic network

A Yammer Basic network cannot coexist with a Yammer Enterprise network on Office 365. If your domain was added to your Office 365 tenant by a Global Administrator (“Global Admin”), the Yammer Basic network will be disassociated from your domain. After 30 days, the Basic network associated with your domain will be disabled and set for deletion.

**To preserve data from the network formerly associated with your domain**:

1. Click Settings ![Yammer settings icon](../media/9704ce70-56ce-43f7-96c6-f253b0413d40.png) in the home Yammer network of your Office 365 tenant.
2. Choose the network formerly associated with your domain from the list of available networks.
3. Export the data for the network formerly associated with your domain. For instructions, see [Export data from Yammer Enterprise](export-yammer-basic-data.md). None of the data from your Yammer Basic Network will be migrated to your Yammer Enterprise network for your Office 365 tenant.

## Additional information
