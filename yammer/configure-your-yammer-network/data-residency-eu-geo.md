# Data residency in the European Union Geo (Preview)
Yammer Data Residency in the European Union (EU) offers local data residency to help organizations in the EU meet their data residency requirements. It is a commitment to store certain types of customer data at rest within the EU geographical area (Geo). Customer data stored at rest in the EU may be stored in any of the data center locations assigned to the EU Geo and is not bound to one specific EU country.

> [!NOTE]

> Yammer data residency in the EU Geo is in Preview. Once Preview is finished:
> - The country you enroll in Office 365 from will determine which Geo your network is associated with. 
> - For a new Yammer Enterprise network, Microsoft will store Yammer message bodies and files in legacy Yammer Groups at rest only in the Yammer Enterprise network Geo.
> - Files in Office 365 Connected Groups will be stored in SharePoint Online per your SharePoint Online data residency policy.
