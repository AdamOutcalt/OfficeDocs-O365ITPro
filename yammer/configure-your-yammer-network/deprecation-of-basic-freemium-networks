# Deprecation of Basic/Freemium Networks


We will be deprecating Yammer Basic/Freemium networks by the end of 2022 for smoother integration and bringing exciting new functionality to our customers.

### Q. We still want a Yammer network. What can we do?

**A.** If your organization has an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 license, enterprise Yammer is included—see [Add Yammer basic domains to your Office 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/add-basic-domains-to-office-365).

If your organization doesn't have a license, [subscriptions  are available](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans) starting at $8 per user per month.

### Q. My organization has an enterprise Yammer network, but we have users from Freemium networks collaborating with us. Can they still join our network as guests after it’s discontinued?

**A.** Not unless they upgrade their license too. If you’re based in the US, you can invite them to collaborate with you through an [external network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/yammer/work-with-external-users/create-and-manage-an-external-network).

### Q. What if we want to keep all our data from the old network and move it to the new network?

**A.** Contact [YammerBasicDeprecation@service.microsoft.com](mailto:YammerBasicDeprecation@service.microsoft.com) as soon as possible to discuss options. We want to make this transition as simple as possible for you.

### Q. What is the latest date we can upgrade and maintain access to our Basic/Freemium network data?

**A.** You will lose access to your old network on or before December 1, 2022. Data will be deleted 30 days after loss of access. It is critical that your organization make the decision whether to upgrade your network and migrate your data, and contact the deprecation team at  [YammerBasicDeprecation@service.microsoft.com](mailto:YammerBasicDeprecation@service.microsoft.com), prior to June 30, 2022 because additional support is required for organizations located outside of the US.
