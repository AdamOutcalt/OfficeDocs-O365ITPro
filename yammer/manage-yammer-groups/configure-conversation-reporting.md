# Report a Yammer conversation overview

 Yammer Networks that are in the New Yammer Preview now have access to a new report conversations capability that enables users within the network to report conversations, comments, and replies in Yammer.

If your network is eligible, you can enable the feature in the Yammer admin center. On the **Network Admin panel**, under **Settings**, you will see a new Report Conversations option under **Content and Security**. This feature is not yet available on the mobile app.

## Setting up the report a conversation feature

A network admin must enable **Report Conversations** in the Yammer network admin panel.
