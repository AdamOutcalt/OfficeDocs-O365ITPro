# Live events in Yammer


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your communication needs are changing. Weâ€™re ready to help. In April, we announced that temporary default limit increases would be enabled for Microsoft 365 live events to help better support customers, through July 1st. To continue meeting the needs of customers, we will extend the temporary default limits until October 1, 2020. Live events hosted in Teams, Stream, and Yammer will continue to temporarily support events for up to 20,000 attendees, 16 hours in length, and 50 events happening simultaneously. Additionally, customers can host a live event in Stream for up to 100,000 attendees when planned though the Microsoft [live events assistance program](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/live-events/assistance/).

To bring the members of a community together centered around an event, Yammer group admins can host a live video event including Yammer conversations before, during, and after the event.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When setting up a live event, we recommend that you configure your video, community, and user permissions at least 24 hours before the event for the best experience. This includes such settings as adding users, updating video permissions, and changing a community from private to public. It can take up to two hours for certain changes to propagate across Microsoft Stream, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Yammer. Allowing 24 hours or more can provide time for testing and making adjustments if needed.

Live events can be held in a public group to reach all employees or in a private group so that only those with membership in the group can participate.

## Types of live events

To understand how Yammer, Stream, and Teams work together in live events, see [Overview of live events](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events#overview). 
Live events can be created and viewed in Yammer, Stream, or Teams. This article explains the requirements for creating and viewing a live event in Yammer. 

There are two ways live events in Yammer can be produced. The requirements depend on which video production methods you intend to use in your organization.

- **Use an external encoder to produce your live event**: 
 
    This type of event is typically used for large-scale events such as executive town halls, where a single stream from a media mixer is broadcasted to the audience. 

    - This type of event uses Stream to encode the broadcast stream.
    - You need to use an external encoder (app or device) to produce the event.
    - Attendees view the event in Yammer.
    
- **Use Teams to produce your live event**:  

    This is used for simple events when all you need are the audio and video devices connected to the presenter's computer, or when you're inviting a remote presenter for the event. 
   
    - This type of event uses Teams to encode the broadcast stream.
    - Use Teams to share content from the presenters webcab and screen.
    - Attendees can view this event in Teams only.

## Yammer network and group requirements

 - To host a live event in Yammer, your organization must have **Enforce Office 365 identity** selected, and you must be using Microsoft 365 connected Yammer groups. For more information see [Enforce Office 365 identity for Yammer users](../configure-your-yammer-network/enforce-office-365-identity.md) and [Yammer and Office 365 groups](../manage-yammer-groups/yammer-and-office-365-groups.md).

- The event must be held in either a public Yammer Microsoft 365 connected group, or a private Yammer Microsoft 365 connected group that includes everyone who will be invited to the live event. For more information, see [Create a group in Yammer](https://support.office.com/article/create-a-group-in-yammer-b407af4f-9a58-4b12-b43e-afbb1b07c889) and [Manage a group in Yammer](https://support.office.com/article/manage-a-group-in-yammer-6e05c6d6-5548-4c88-89cd-e6757a514ef2). 

- The **All Company** group can't be used for live events.

## Requirements for live event attendees

- Everyone who attends a Yammer live event must have a Microsoft 365 or an Office 365 plan that includes a license for Yammer (for example, Office 365 A3, A5, F1, E1, E3, or E5) and Microsoft Stream.

- Only members of your Yammer network can attend live events. Guests and external users do not have access to live events.

- For live events in public groups, all members of your Yammer network can attend. For live events in private groups, attendees must be members of the private group in which the live event is hosted. 

- For attending a live event in Teams, a Teams license is required. 

## Permissions for scheduling, creating, and producing live events in Yammer

Yammer has partnered with Teams and Stream to provide the best technology for running your live event. Because of this, creation and production of live events require Stream and/or Teams licenses and specific permissions. These permissions aren't controlled in Yammer settings. The requirements depend on the production methods you plan to use.

- **Scheduling**:

    - Only Yammer group admins can create and schedule a live event in Yammer.
    - When a live event is scheduled in Yammer, the organizer, any co-producers, and presenters will receive a calendar invite with information about this live event (as a placeholder). This invite is not sent to attendees.

- **Producing**:

    - **Events produced using an external app or device**:
        To produce any kind of event in Yammer, you will need to have your Microsoft Stream license enabled. For external app or device events, the person who presents or produces the event must have a Stream license and permission to create live events. By default, only Microsoft Stream administrators have permission to create live events. Use the Stream admin settings to give permission to specific users. For steps to grant or remove permissions in Stream, see [Administration controls for live events in Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/live-event-administration).

    - **Events produced using Teams**:
        The person who presents or produces the event must have a Teams license and specific policies set in Teams. For requirements, see [Who can create and schedule live events in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events#who-can-create-and-schedule-live-events). For steps to set policies, see [Set up live events policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events#step-3-set-up-live-events-policies). 
 
### Restrict creation of live events in Yammer

You can prevent creation of live events produced in teams, live events produced with other tools, or both.

- To prevent creation of live events produced in Teams, remove permissions in Teams for live event scheduling. If a user does not have a license or permission to create a live event in Teams, when they create a live event in Yammer, the produce in Teams option is unavailable.

- If you do not have permission to create live events in Stream, you cannot create live events in Yammer.

## FAQ

**Q: How many participants can view a live event at once?**

A. Currently the limit is 10,000 participants. For events of a higher size, work through the [Live Events Assistance Program](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/live-events/assistance/).

**Q: What media player is used for live events?**

Events produced using Teams use the Azure Media Player.

Events produced using an external app or device use the Stream player.

Both work on desktop, web, and mobile devices (iOS and Android).

**Q: How can I make it easy for my event organizers to get help?**

In Microsoft 365 and Office 365, you can customize the help pane that comes up when users click the Help icon to add contact information for your local support staff. For more information, see [Add customized help desk info to the help pane](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/misc/customize-help-desk).
