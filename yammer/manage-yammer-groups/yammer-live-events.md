# Live events in Yammer

To bring the members of a community together centered around an event, Yammer group admins can host a live video event including Yammer conversations before, during, and after the event. Live events can be held in a public group to reach all employees or in a private group so that only those with membership in the group can participate. 

This article lists the Yammer network requirements, licenses, and permissions for organizing and participating in live events.

## Permissions for scheduling, creating, and producing live events in Yammer

Yammer has partnered with Teams and Stream to provide the best technology for running your live event. Because of this, creation and production of live events require Stream and/or Teams licenses and specific permissions. These permissions are not controlled in Yammer settings. The requirements depend on the production methods you plan to use.

- **Scheduling**:

    - A Teams license is required to schedule a Yammer live event.

    - Only Yammer group admins can create and schedule a live event.

- **Producing**:
    - **Events produced using an external app or device**:
        For external app or device events, the person who presents or produces the event must have a Stream license and permission to create live events. By default, only Microsoft Stream administrators have permission to create live events. Use the Stream admin settings to give permission to specific users. For steps to grant or remove permissions in Stream, see [Administration controls for live events in Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/live-event-administration).

    - **Events produced using Teams**:
        The person who presents or produces the event must have a Teams license and specific policies set in Teams. For requirements, see [Who can create and schedule live events in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events#who-can-create-and-schedule-live-events). For steps to set policies, see [Set up live events policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events#step-3-set-up-live-events-policies). 
 
### Restrict creation of live events in Yammer

You can prevent creation of live events produced in teams, live events produced with other tools, or both.

- To prevent creation of live events produced in Teams, remove permissions in Teams for live event scheduling. If a user does not have a license or permission to create a live event in Teams, when they create a live event in Yammer, the produce in Teams option is unavailable.

- To prevent external production for live events, don't give Stream permissions to any users. If a user does not have a license or permission to create a live event in Stream, when they try to create a live event in Yammer, the external production option is are unavailable.

- To prevent both types of live events, make sure Yammer users do not have permission to create live events in Teams and in Stream.
