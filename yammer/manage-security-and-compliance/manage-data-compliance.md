# Manage Yammer data compliance

As a verified admin, you can keep your users' Yammer posts appropriate and meet security and compliance requirements. You can set up alerts for content that matches keywords, set data retention policies, and if needed, you can view private content. You can also [export data from Yammer](export-yammer-enterprise-data.md).

## Monitor Keywords

Monitor sensitive content by specifying keywords such as banned words or employees' personal information. All messages in internal and external networks, including messages to and from external participants can be monitored.
  
 **Set person responsible for monitoring, editing, and deleting flagged posts**
  
1. In the Yammer admin center, go to **Content and security** > **Monitor Keywords**, and enter the person's email address in **Email Address**. This person should be a verified admin so they have permission to delete messages anywhere in Yammer.
    
2. When a post matches a keyword, the person listed in **Email Address** receives an email. They can then click a link in the email to review, edit, or delete the flagged post. 
    
 **Specify keywords and phrases to monitor**
  
1. In the Yammer admin center, go to **Content and Security** \> **Monitor Keywords**.
    
2. Enter the words and phrases you want to monitor, each on its own line.
    
    You can use regular expresssions to match patterns. For information on using regular expressions, see [Regular Expression Language](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524073).
    
    Here are some examples of regular expressions commonly used for monitoring.
    
|**Purpose**|**Pattern**|**Matches**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Word boundary  <br/> |\bword\b  <br/> |\btheme\b matches "theme" but not "themes" or "them"  <br/> |
|Credit cards  <br/> |\b(?:\d[ ‐]\*?){13,16}\b  <br/> |1234 5678 90123  <br/> 1234 5678 9012 3456  <br/> 1234‐5678‐9012‐3456  <br/> |

## Data retention

You can control whether deleted messages are retained.

    Data can be permanently deleted by using the Developer API. For information, see the [Developer API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=874797) on the Yammer Developer Center.
