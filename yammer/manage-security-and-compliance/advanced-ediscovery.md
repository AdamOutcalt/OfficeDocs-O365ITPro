# Advanced eDiscovery in Yammer networks

Yammer supports both eDiscovery and Advanced eDiscovery within the Microsoft Security and Compliance Center.

To use this functionality, your Yammer network will need to be in Native Mode. If your network was provisioned after January 9th, 2020, you are already in Native Mode. If your network was provisioned *before* January 9th, 2020, you will need to follow the steps in the [Native Mode Alignment Tool](../configure-your-yammer-network/overview-native-mode.md).

You can learn more about eDiscovery in the [Microsoft Security and Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/) and [Advanced eDiscovery](advanced-ediscovery.md) (coming soon for Yammer).

The processes outlined in the above documentation explains how to run eDiscovery searches on all your Microsoft content. While Yammer isnâ€™t discussed explicitly in those documents, the same processes that are mentioned there apply to Yammer content. When writing a search query in either eDiscovery or Advanced eDiscovery, you can filter on Yammer content specifically by selecting **Yammer Messages** as the *Type* of content as shown in the screenshots below.

## eDiscovery

## Advanced eDiscovery

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to select Yammer messages as the Type to ensure Yammer messages will be included in your results. This option allows you to filter so that your results only include Yammer messages.

When viewing Yammer content in the eDiscovery tools, you can expect the following information to be available:

- Message Body
- Author
- Recipients
- Timestamp

We plan to continue updating the service over time to include more information not listed above.
