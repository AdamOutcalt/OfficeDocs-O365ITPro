## Troubleshooting admin roles - FAQ

### Q: Can I change my own admin role for Yammer?

A: No. Admins can't edit their own roles.
  
### Q: How can I find out who the network and verified admins are for our network?

A: Non‚Äêadmin users can see all admins in the **Members** list in the **All Company** group. Admins have a  next to their name. They can also see a list of admins at **https://yammer.com/***your_network***/admin**.
  
Admins can view the list of admins: in the Yammer admin center, select **Admins**. Admins can also export a list of admins to review who has Network Admin role, and who has the Verified Admin role. In the Yammer admin center, select **Export Users**. In the exported .ZIP file, open **Admins.csv**. 
  
### Q: I'm an Office 365 global admin, and when I log on to Yammer, why don't I see any admin tools?

A: Check the following troubleshooting options to determine why your admin isn't receiving emails from Yammer:
  
1. Has the admin created a Yammer account?
    
    The Office 365 automated process syncs the Global Admin as a verified admin in Yammer, but the user must still create an account in Yammer to receive a confirmation email.
    
2. Is the admin on the correct domain?
    
    The user must have an email address that is in the same company domain that you've used to activate Yammer. If you create an admin in customer.uk, but the Yammer network you've activated is customer.com, the admin will not be synced as a Yammer Verified Admin. For more information on how to edit an admin's domain, see [Set up your Yammer network (Yammer activation guide)](https://support.office.com/article/e10998fe-f001-42f3-9597-b170d360f475).
    
3. Is the admin using a generic email?
    
    An admin cannot have a generic email address and must be assigned to a real user. To regulate this, there are certain words that are not allowed in the email address of a Global Admin:
    
      - admin, noreply, help, support, workfeed, feedback, yammer, api, abuse, postmaster, hostmaster, root, new, create, index, show, destroy, delete, and update
    
4. Has your company added Yammer.com to the Safe Recipients list?
    
    Your email service could be blocking emails from the Yammer domain. Please check to make sure Yammer.com is on a Safe Recipients list at your company and is not otherwise prevented from delivering emails.
