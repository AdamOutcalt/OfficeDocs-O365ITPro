# Yammer update on Internet Explorer 11 changes coming in August 2021

Yammer, along with other Microsoft 365 and services, will be retiring support for Internet Explorer 11 in August 2021. With the advances in web technology over the years, Internet Explorer 11 no longer provides the best experience to our customers.

We recommend transitioning to the new Microsoft Edge to take advantage of all that Yammer and Microsoft 365 apps and services has to offer. Internet Explorer 11 will continue to be supported by Microsoft as part of the OS lifecycle policy, and you can continue to access your legacy websites through Internet Explorer 11. However, the new IE Mode in the new Microsoft Edge enables users to access legacy websites within the modern browser.

## What to expect from Yammer?

Leading up to August 2021 we will provide multiple in-product messages to help users transition over to a new modern browser. In August 2021, users will no longer be able to access Yammer and all its integrations from Internet Explorer 11.

For customers using Yammer Embed, we are working on updating Embed with the new Yammer experience, but this will not be available on Internet Explorer 11. To get the new Yammer Embed experience, you will need to access it from Edge or another modern browser. 

For customers using Yammer Embed on custom-built sites in Internet Explorer 11, we recommend configuring your site to be supported in IE mode in Edge. This will allow your users to still access all your site has to offer from a new modern browser. For more information about how to configure IE mode for your site, see [Configure IE mode policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-policies). 

## How to prepare?

We recommend that you communicate to your users about this change. If you have not already deployed Edge or allow users to access other modern browsers, we recommend that you do so. For technical documentation, see [Plan your deployment of Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/deploy-edge-plan-deployment).

For customers who would like guidance on how to plan, deploy, or adopt the new Microsoft Edge, thereâ€™s [FastTrack](https://docs.microsoft.com/fasttrack/win-10-microsoft-edge-assistance-offered). FastTrack is available at no additional charge to customers with 150 or more paid seats of Windows 10 Enterprise. To get started, submit a [Request for Assistance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/win-10-microsoft-edge-assistance-offered) through the FastTrack site.

If you have any other questions regarding Yammer retiring support for IE11, please reach out to our support team. We are committed to helping make this a smooth transition for our customers. If you have more general Microsoft 365 feedback, questions or concerns please refer to the resources below or contact GetHelp.
