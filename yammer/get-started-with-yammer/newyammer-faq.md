# New Yammer Preview Customer Terms and FAQ

Yammer has been completely redesigned, with dozens of new capabilities that power leadership engagement, company-wide communication, and communities in Microsoft 365. The new Yammer delivers a beautiful, intelligent experience across devices and deep integration with Microsoft Teams and Outlook. And, as part of Microsoft 365, people can connect and share knowledge across the organization with open conversations backed by enterprise-grade privacy, security, and compliance.

As Microsoft’s first app built from the ground up with the Fluent Design System, the new Yammer provides an engaging and easy-to-use experience on the web and in the Yammer app for Android and iOS. In addition, Yammer can be integrated with Microsoft Teams, as a Communities app in the left rail, enabling you to access organization-wide communities without leaving the hub for teamwork. Integration with Outlook lets you read, like, and reply to Yammer conversations within your Outlook inbox. 
 
Building on a decade of customer success and feedback, the new Yammer delivers many top customer requests. A new, personalized conversation feed powered by AI connects you with conversations across the organization. Each community can be given a unique identity with branding and cover photos. Communicators can highlight conversations with pinned posts and close discussions to prevent replies. Leaders can broadcast live and on-demand events with a new, simpler production option using webcams and desktop sharing.

## What’s new and different about this experience?

The new Yammer experience is the first app to be built fully in Fluent, the Microsoft design language, and will strengthen coherence between Yammer and other Microsoft 365 apps. Along with the UI, we've added new capabilities, such as:

- To better convey the purpose of Yammer, Groups are now called Communities.
- Pin your favorite communities to the sidebar.
- Brand your network with your company logo on the home page.
- Brand your communities with vibrant cover photos.
- Customize the All Company community cover photo and avatar.
- Pin important posts at the top of your communities.
- Close conversations that have come to a conclusion.
- Report conversations to better moderate your communities.
- Enhanced discovery feed combines top posts from groups, people, and topics you follow.
- New publisher experience provides the ability to include any type of content an announcement.
- Apply new conversation styling to posts, questions, and praise so they stand out for even greater engagement.
- Rich media uploading and viewing improvements, including recently used file suggestions, enhance engagement.
- Live Events provides a dedicated event page with questions as the default post type.
- New people card experiences are aligned with Microsoft 365.  
- Mobile browsing delivers a responsive design for viewing Yammer.
- Provide feedback without leaving Yammer.

and much more!

## How do I enable the preview within my organization?  

Yammer network administrators can configure access to the new Yammer preview through the Yammer admin portal. From there, they can enable the preview toggle to display in the suite header and choose to default to classic Yammer or enable the new Yammer across their network. For more information about managing the opt-in settings, see [Bring the new Yammer Preview to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

## Who is eligible to access the new experience?

Once enabled by a network admin, people in your organization who sign into Yammer with Microsoft 365 will be able to view the toggle to opt-in to the new experience. This will be available for canonical (home) networks only. Microsoft 365 users who participate in external networks will see participate using the classic Yammer experience. During the public preview, users will always be able to access a direct link to the new experience. If your organization wants to remove all access to the new Yammer during the preview phase, you will need to [contact Microsoft support](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online).

## Will I know when additional changes are coming?

We will update this document as we launch new features and post on the Admin Message Center whenever we have any major announcements.

## Are there any expectations around participating in the preview?

Thank you for helping us shape the future of Yammer! As part of the customer preview, we’re asking for your help getting feedback on the new experience. This comes in two parts:

1. You, as the customer, accept that features will change during the preview and certain capabilities might not be at parity with the classic Yammer experience.

2. The new Yammer experience will give the ability for end-users in your organization to provide feedback about the experience from within the app. If they choose to opt-out of the new experience, they will be prompted with an option to tell us about their experience at that time.

    During the customer preview, the ability to provide feedback will need to be available for all users in the new experience. The feedback experience will not collect any data that can be tied back to the user.

## Yammer Preview Customer Support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new Yammer public preview is unsupported. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Microsoft Online Services does not apply to this preview.

If you contact Microsoft Support for break-fix support, support engineers will check whether or not the issue is occurring with the classic Yammer product. If an issue is found with the classic version of Yammer, then the issue will follow the standard SLAs.

When an issue occurs with only the public preview and it can be reproduced by Microsoft Support, then the issue will be logged for later investigation by the Yammer product group. The support case will be closed when adequate information has been captured. It may not be possible to resolve all issues reported during the public preview.

## Do SLAs apply to the new Yammer preview?

The Service Level Agreement for Microsoft Online Services does not apply to this preview.

## What is a break-fix issue? 

Break-fix issues are technical problems you experience while using the new Yammer preview. *Break-fix* is an industry term that refers to *work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order*. 

## How do I open a support case?

Please see the [Microsoft 365 Admin Help page](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online) for general information. Your organization may have specific guidance for opening support cases, so you may need to talk with your IT team.

## How should I submit feature requests and feedback?

Feature requests and feedback on the product during preview should be submitted through the in-product feedback dialog boxes. Feedback can also be provided with peers through the [new Yammer preview tech community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/new-yammer-preview/bd-p/NewYammerPreview).

Microsoft Support will not be accepting formal feature requests for the new Yammer preview submitted via the Design Change Request (DCR) process during the preview period.


## What severity of cases should be accepted during the preview?

Please open non-critical (severity B or C) cases during the preview period for break/fix issues affecting the new Yammer preview. In some cases, you may need to temporarily revert to the classic Yammer experience while an issue is investigated.

Critical (severity A) cases will not be accepted for new Yammer preview features. Any critical severity case impacting only the new Yammer preview will be downgraded by support after investigation.

## What steps should I take before reporting a technical problem?

Before reporting a technical problem to Microsoft Support, please check the following:

- **Can the issue be reproduced consistently?** If the issue is not occurring now, then it may have been resolved by a recent product update.
- **Does the issue only occur for the new Yammer preview?** Or, does it also occur with the old user experience too?  
- **Can the issue be reproduced in multiple browsers?** Testing with at least two different web browsers is a best practice. 
- **Does the issue show up on mobile as well?** Sometimes issues occur with a backend service and can affect multiple clients (web, mobile, or desktop.)
- **Are multiple users affected?** Issues affecting multiple users are more likely to be prioritized.
- **Do you have clear screenshots?** Closely cropped screenshots can miss important information that is showing elsewhere on the screen.
- **Is there any relevant information in the browser developer tools?** Support may ask you to check the JavaScript console for error information. While not everyone is familiar with JavaScript, you can often hit F12 in your browser on Windows and look for red error messages in the console tab.

## FAQ

**Q: Can we opt out of the preview at any time?**
A: You can remove the preview toggle for your entire network through the new Yammer preview setting in the Yammer Admin Portal. Any users who have opted into the new Yammer experience will remain in that experience until they choose to go back to the classic experience. For more information about managing the available options, see [Bring the new Yammer Preview to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

**Q: Is the new experience available for customers that have a Yammer network with EU data residency?**

A: Yes!  
 
**Q: We have Yammer embedded in various places in our Intranet (i.e. Yammer Tab in Microsoft Teams, Yammer Web Part for SharePoint, Yammer Embed). How will those be impacted by the new Yammer?**

A: Initially there will not be any change to these experiences. Eventually, these experiences will have the same design as the new Yammer.

**Q: What about guest users in external groups?**

A: Users will either see the new Yammer or the classic Yammer experience depending on the state of their home network. If your network hosts an external group, people within your network that are opted-in will see that group in the new Yammer experience. Any guest users within the external group will see the classic Yammer experience if their network is not yet enabled for the new experience.  

**Q: What about external networks?**

A: Users can continue to access external networks through the Network Switcher icon available on the integrated tool bar at the top of every page. On switching, users will see these external networks in the classic experience.
 
**Q: Is the new Yammer fully accessible?**

A: Yes, our new Yammer web experience meets the industry’s accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0) which means that our core scenarios meet accessibility requirements. However, there are non-core scenarios where users may run into accessibility issues but these scenarios won’t hinder the full Yammer experience.

**Q: Are all languages supported in the new Yammer?**

A: All languages available in classic Yammer are available in the public preview.

**Q: Can users get to the new Yammer preview without administrator changes?**

A: A Microsoft 365 admin can control whether or not users in their organization can see the toggle to opt into the new Yammer experience. But users will always be able to access web.yammer.com while the new Yammer is in the public preview phase. If your organization wants to remove all access to the new Yammer during the preview phase, you will need to [contact Microsoft support](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online).

**Q: I don’t want to enable the new experience for my production Yammer network yet. How can I test out the new toggle?**
 
A: You can try out the opt-in toggles on your existing test network. If you don’t have a test environment, you can create [a new trial tenant](https://signup.microsoft.com/) for testing and enable the toggle there.
