# New Yammer FAQ

Yammer has been completely redesigned, with dozens of new capabilities that power leadership engagement, company-wide communication, and communities in Microsoft 365. New Yammer delivers a beautiful, intelligent experience across devices and deep integration with Microsoft Teams and Outlook. As part of Microsoft 365, people can connect and share knowledge across the organization with open conversations backed by enterprise-grade privacy, security, and compliance.

As Microsoft’s first app built from the ground up with the Fluent Design System, new Yammer provides an engaging and easy-to-use experience on the web and in the Yammer app for Android and iOS. In addition, Yammer can be integrated with Microsoft Teams, as a Communities app in the left rail, enabling you to access organization-wide communities without leaving the hub for teamwork. Integration with Outlook lets you read, like, and reply to Yammer conversations within your Outlook inbox. Yammer also provides an updated integration experience in SharePoint Online with the  Conversations web part.
 
Building on a decade of customer success and feedback, new Yammer delivers many top customer requests. A new, personalized conversation feed powered by AI connects you with conversations across the organization. Each community can be given a unique identity with branding and cover photos. Communicators can highlight conversations with pinned posts and close discussions to prevent replies. Leaders can broadcast live and on-demand events with a new, simpler production option using webcams and desktop sharing.

## What’s new and different about this experience?

The new Yammer experience is built fully in Fluent, the Microsoft design language, strengthening coherence between Yammer and other Microsoft 365 apps. Along with the UI, we've added new capabilities, such as:

- To better convey the purpose of Yammer, groups are now called communities.
- Pin your favorite communities to the sidebar to make them easier to find.
- Brand your network with your company logo on the home page.
- Make your communities shine with vibrant cover photos.
- Customize All Company, just like any other community, by adding a cover photo and avatar.
- Restrict posting in All Company to make it an official company news community.
- Pin important posts at the top of your communities to ensure members see them.
- Close conversations that have come to a conclusion.
- Enable users to report conversations to better moderate your network.
- Enhanced home feed helps users discover top posts from communities, people, and topics they follow.
- New publisher experience provides the ability to include any type of content in an announcement and to announce any type of post.
- With new bolder conversation styling, posts, questions, and praise stand out for even greater engagement.
- Rich media uploading and viewing improvements, including recently used file suggestions, enhance engagement.
- Live Events provides a dedicated event page with questions as the default post type.
- Live events in progress are promoted at the top of the discovery feed.
- Users can create and annotate a short video on a mobile device.
- New people card experiences are aligned with Microsoft 365, presenting a consistent profile experience across all apps.
- New Yammer is great in mobile browsers, delivering a responsive experience that works on the go.
- Provide feedback from the suite header without leaving Yammer.
- Easily switch to external networks from the suite header.

and much more!

## How do I enable new Yammer within my organization?  

Yammer global administrators and verified network admins can configure access to new Yammer through the Yammer admin portal. From there, they can enable the toggle to display in the suite header and choose to default to classic Yammer or enable the new Yammer across their network. For more information about managing the opt-in settings, see [Bring new Yammer to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

## Do you have materials available to help in rolling out the new Yammer within my organization?

Yes! The [Yammer Adoption Center](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/yammer/adoption/) includes materials to help you deploy the new Yammer across your organization. This includes email templates for your internal announcement, Yammer tips and tricks, and a template for the new Community cover photos. There’s also a [Yammer end user guide](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8D13E85F1CF91770!254&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!ACrN15bnGCy_ZTs) to help your organization get up-to-speed quickly. 


## Who is eligible to access the new experience?

Once enabled by a global admin or a verified network admin, people in your organization who sign into Yammer with Microsoft 365 will be able to view the toggle to opt in to the new experience. This will be available for canonical (home) networks only. Microsoft 365 users who participate in external networks will participate using the classic Yammer experience. Users can also access a direct link to the new experience.

## Will I know when additional changes are coming?

We will update this document as we launch new features and post on the Admin Message Center whenever we have any major announcements.

## How do I open a support case?

Please see the [Support for business products - Admin Help page](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online) for general information. Your organization may have specific guidance for opening support cases, so you may need to talk with your IT team.

Feature requests and feedback on the product hould be submitted through the in-product feedback dialog boxes. Feedback can also be provided with peers through the [new Yammer Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer/ct-p/Yammer).

## What steps should I take before reporting a technical problem?

Before reporting a technical problem to Microsoft Support, please check the following:

- **Can the issue be reproduced consistently?** If the issue is not occurring now, then it may have been resolved by a recent product update.
- **Can the issue be reproduced in multiple browsers?** Testing with at least two different web browsers is a best practice. 
- **Does the issue show up on mobile as well?** Sometimes issues occur with a backend service and can affect multiple clients (web, mobile, or desktop.)
- **Are multiple users affected?** Issues affecting multiple users are more likely to be prioritized.
- **Do you have clear screenshots?** Closely cropped screenshots can miss important information that is showing elsewhere on the screen.
- **Is there any relevant information in the browser developer tools?** Support may ask you to check the JavaScript console for error information. While not everyone is familiar with JavaScript, you can often hit F12 in your browser on Windows and look for red error messages in the console tab.

## FAQ

**Q: Can we opt out of new Yammer?**
A: You can remove the toggle for your entire network through the new Yammer setting in the Yammer Admin Portal. Any users who have opted into the new Yammer experience will remain in that experience until they choose to go back to the classic experience. For more information about managing the available options, see [Bring new Yammer to your organization](administrative-settings-opt-in-newyammer.md).

**Q: Is the new experience available for customers that have a Yammer network with EU data residency?**

A: Yes!  
 
**Q: What about guest users in external groups?**

A: Users will either see the new Yammer or the classic Yammer experience depending on the state of their home network. If your network hosts an external group, people within your network that are opted-in will see that group in the new Yammer experience. Any guest users within the external group will see the classic Yammer experience if their network is not yet enabled for the new experience.  

 
**Q: Is the new Yammer fully accessible?**

A: Yes, our new Yammer web experience meets the industry’s accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0) which means that our core scenarios meet accessibility requirements. However, there are non-core scenarios where users may run into accessibility issues but these scenarios won’t hinder the full Yammer experience.

**Q: Are all languages supported in new Yammer?**

A: All languages available in classic Yammer are available in new Yammer.

**Q: Can users get to new Yammer without administrator changes?**

A: A global admin or a verified network admin can control whether or not users in their organization can see the toggle to opt into the new Yammer experience but users will always be able to access web.yammer.com. If your organization wants to remove all access to new Yammer, [contact Microsoft support](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online).

**Q: I don’t want to enable the new experience for my production Yammer network yet. How can I test out the new toggle?**
 
A: You can try out the opt-in toggles on your existing test network. If you don’t have a test environment, you can create [a new trial tenant](https://signup.microsoft.com/) for testing and enable the toggle there.
