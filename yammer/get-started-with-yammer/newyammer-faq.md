Yammer has been completely redesigned, with dozens of new capabilities that power leadership engagement, company-wide communication, and communities in Microsoft 365. The new Yammer delivers a beautiful, intelligent experience across devices and deep integration with Microsoft Teams, SharePoint and Outlook. And, as part of Microsoft 365, people can connect and share knowledge across the organization with open conversations backed by enterprise-grade privacy, security and compliance.

As Microsoft’s first app built from the ground up with the Fluent Design System, the new Yammer provides an engaging and easy-to-use experience on the web and in the Yammer app for Android and iOS. In addition, Yammer can be integrated with Microsoft Teams, as a Communities app in the left rail, enabling you to access organization-wide communities without leaving the hub for teamwork. Integration with Outlook lets you read, like and reply to Yammer conversations within your Outlook inbox. And the Yammer web part for SharePoint introduces Yammer’s new design and features, including questions and answers, to power a social intranet.  
 
Building on a decade of customer success and feedback, the new Yammer delivers many top customer requests. A new, personalized conversation feed powered by AI connects you with conversations across the organization. Each community can be given a unique identity with branding and cover photos. Communicators can highlight conversations with pinned posts and close discussions to prevent replies. Leaders can broadcast live and on-demand events with a new, simpler production option using webcams and desktop sharing.

## What’s new and different about this experience?

The new Yammer experience is the first app to be built fully in Fluent, the Microsoft design language, and will strengthen coherence between Yammer and other Microsoft 365 apps. Along with the UI, we've added new capabilities, such as:

- To better convey the purpose of Yammer, Groups are now called Communities. 
- Pin your favorite communities to the sidebar. 
- Brand your network with your company logo on the home page. 
- Brand your communities with vibrant cover photos. 
- Customize the All Company community cover photo and avatar. 
- Pin important posts at the top of your communities. 
- Close conversations that have come to a conclusion. 
- Report conversations to better moderate your communities. 
- Enhanced discovery feed combines top posts from groups, people and topics you follow.
- New publisher experience provides the ability to include any type of content an announcement. 
- Apply new conversation styling to posts, questions, and praise so they stand out for even greater engagement. 
- Rich media uploading and viewing improvements, including recently used file suggestions, enhance engagement. 
- Live Events provides a dedicated event page with questions as the default post type. 
- New people card experiences are aligned with Microsoft 365.  
- Mobile browsing delivers a responsive design for viewing Yammer. 
- Provide feedback without leaving Yammer.

and much more!
