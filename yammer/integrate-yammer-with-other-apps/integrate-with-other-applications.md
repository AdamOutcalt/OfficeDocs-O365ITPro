# Integrate Yammer with other applications

Yammer offers a variety of integrations to help make other applications more mobile and social. 
  
> [!TIP]
> For many integrations, it is helpful to know [how to find a Yammer group's feedID](https://support.office.com/article/b0e49b2c-ca30-4025-b3bc-7bd764c3e2ec). 
  
## Yammer for SharePoint

## Yammer Embed

 [Yammer Embed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524147) delivers Yammer feeds to existing business applications, such as Skype for Business, the company intranet, CRM tools, or content management systems. 

## Yammer Connect

The [Yammer connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/yammer/) is a host of social plug‐ins that gives you the flexibility to extend Yammer's social functionality across enterprise applications. 
  
## Yammer and Flow

- For a list of flow templates for connecting flow and Yammer, see [Flow Yammer templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_yammer/yammer/).
