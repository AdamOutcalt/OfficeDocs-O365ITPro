# Add storage space for your subscription

If you start to run out of storage for your SharePoint Online site collections, you can add storage to your subscription if your plan is eligible. If you don't see the **Office 365 Extra File Storage** in the list of available add-ons, it means your plan is not eligible. For more information, see [Is my plan eligible?](#is-my-plan-eligible-for-office-365-extra-file-storage)

3. In the admin center, select **Admin centers** \> **SharePoint**.

4. On the **Site collections** menu, view the amount of storage used.
