# Change your payment frequency

When you buy a subscription, you choose monthly or annual billing. To change how often you are billing for a subscription, use the following steps.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing**\> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page.

2. Find the subscription that you want to change. In the **Billing** section, next to either **Billed monthly** or **Billed annually**, select **Edit**.

3. Choose the option for how often you want to be billed, then select **Change**.
