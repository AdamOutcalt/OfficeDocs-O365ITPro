# Upgrade to a different plan

When your business changes, or you need more features, you can upgrade plans. The easiest way to do this is to use the **Upgrade** tab in the admin center. However, using the **Upgrade** tab isn't supported in all situations. In some cases, you might be able to change plans manually.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to the new admin center. If you're not using the new Microsoft 365 admin center, you can turn it on by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page. To view the article about the old admin center, see [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](switch-to-a-different-plan.md).

## Use the Upgrade tab

When you use the **Upgrade** tab, you're led through the process of buying a new plan. All users are automatically assigned licenses in the new plan, and your old plan is canceled for you.

1. In the Admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page.

2. Select the subscription that you want to upgrade.

3. On the subscription details page, select **Upgrade**.

4. Find the plan to which you want to upgrade, then select the **Upgrade** button.

5. Enter the number of licenses that you need, choose whether to pay each month or for the whole year, then select **Go to checkout**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure you buy enough licenses to cover all your users.

6. On the next page, verify the **Sold to** address, the **Billed to** information, and **Items in this order**. You can change the default payment method at this step. If you need to make any changes, select **Change** next to the applicable section.

7. When you're finished, select **Place order**.

When you finish checkout, it might take a few minutes to finalize the upgrade. You can start using your new subscription right away. Select **Check upgrade status** to check the progress of the upgrade. You'll be notified when the upgrade is complete. The notification is displayed on the **Products & services** page, next to your new subscription.

## The Upgrade tab is empty

If the **Upgrade** tab is empty, you'll see an explanation of why you can't upgrade at this time. You can try to [change plans manually](../misc/change-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md). For more information, see [Why can't I switch Office 365 for business plans?](../misc/why-can-t-i-switch-plans.md).

## I don't see the plan I want

When you use the **Upgrade** tab, the plans that you can upgrade to are displayed based on the services in your current plan. You can only use the **Upgrade** tab to move to a plan that has the same data-related services, or to a higher version. This ensures that users don't lose data related to those services during the change.

If you want to move to a plan with fewer services, you can [change plans manually](../misc/change-plans-manually.md), or [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.

## Why some changes take longer

**Number of assigned users:** If you have a large number of assigned users, it will take longer to do the upgrade to move them to the new plan.

**Credit checks when changing plans:** If you pay by invoice, or reach a certain level of cost, a credit check might be required. A credit check can take up to two business days. Users will have full access to their current plan until you move them to the new one. You'll receive a notification if a credit check is required.
