# Reactivate your subscription

If your subscription expires, or was disabled by Microsoft, or if you cancelled it in the middle of a subscription term, you can reactivate it in the admin center.
  
 **Not an admin?** Contact your administration to reactivate your subscription.

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

## Use the new admin center to reactivate your subscription

The new admin center is available to all Microsoft 365 admins. You can opt in by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page. For more information, see [About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page.

2. On the **Products & services** page, find the subscription that you want to reactivate. In the **Billing** section, select **Reactivate**.
  
    If you don't see **Reactivate** as an available action, [call Support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md) to reactivate your subscription.

3. Confirm your payment details. You can update your existing payment information here. When you're finished entering your payment method, select **Reactivate**.

  - If your subscription was expired, then after you submit your payment details, your subscription returns to an active state, and the **Next billing** date extends by either one month or one year, depending on your current subscription commitment. If you pay by credit card or bank account, your credit card or bank account will be charged for the extension. If you pay by invoice, you'll see the extension reflected on your next invoice. To make sure that your subscription doesn't expire again, follow the steps to [Turn Recurring billing on or off](renew-your-subscription.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The ability to pay by bank account isn't available in some countries or regions.
  
  - If your subscription was cancelled, or was disabled because a payment wasn't received, it returns to an active state, and your **Next billing** date stays the same.
