# Add, update, or remove your payment methods

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"
You can purchase products and services from Microsoft with a credit or debit card, or bank account. You can enter your payment information on the **Payment methods** page, or when you make a purchase.

You can only manage payment methods that you've added.

> [!NOTE]
> The option to pay with a bank account is not available in some countries or regions.
>
> You must use a credit card issued from the same country as your tenant.

## Add a payment method

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Select **Add a payment method**.
3. On the **Payment methods** page, pick a payment method from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter the information for the new card or bank account, then select **Add**.

## Update an existing payment method

You can't change the number on an existing card or bank account. If the card or bank account number has changed, add it as a new payment method. Next, pick it as the payment option for your subscription, then remove the existing card or bank account. You must use a card issued from the same country as your tenant.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. On the **Payment methods** page, pick the card or bank account to update, then select **Edit**.
3. Update your payment method information (name on the card or bank account, billing address, phone number, or expiration date), then select **Save**.

## Change a payment method

You can change the payment method that is used to pay for a single subscription. You can also move all subscriptions from one payment method to another.

### Change the payment method used for a single subscription

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that you want to pay for with the new card or bank account. Under **Billing**, next to the payment method, select **Edit**.
3. Next to your existing payment method, select **Change**.
4. From the drop-down menu, select an alternate payment method, or choose to add a payment method.
5. If you add a payment method, enter the card or account details, then select **Save**.
6. Verify that the selected payment method is correct, then select **Save**.

### Change the payment method used for multiple subscriptions

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Next to the payment method you want to change, select the **More** menu (three dots), and then select **Change subscriptions**.
3. The **Change payment method** pane lists existing subscriptions that use that payment method.
4. From the **Select payment method** drop-down, select a different payment method, then select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only change between existing payment methods in the **Change payment method** pane. If you want to change to pay by invoice, see [Change from credit card or bank account to invoice](change-payment-method.md#change-from-credit-card-or-bank-account-to-invoice).

## Remove a payment method

You can only remove a credit or debit card or bank account from your list of payment methods if it’s not attached to a subscription. This applies to all subscriptions, whatever their status. Add a payment method for the subscription, then remove the old one from that subscription. If the payment method is associated with a billing profile, change the payment method used for the billing profile, and then remove the payment method.

### Delete a payment method

If your payment method isn't associated with any subscriptions, you can immediately delete it.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Hover over the card or bank account, then select the delete icon.
3. At the bottom of the **Delete payment method** pane, select **Delete**.

### Add an alternate payment method used to pay for subscriptions

If your payment method is associated with any subscriptions and you don't have an alternate payment method on file, first add a payment method. Next, change the payment method used to pay for the subscriptions. Then you can delete the payment method.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Hover over the card or bank account, then select the delete icon.
3. The **Delete payment method** pane lists existing subscriptions that use that payment method.
4. Select **Add a payment method**.
5. Select the type of payment method you want to add, enter the account information, then select **Add**.
6. Select the new payment method from the drop-down list, then select **Change**.
    > [!WARNING]
    > This will move all subscriptions to the new payment method.
7. Select **Delete**.

### Change the payment method used to pay for subscriptions

If your payment method is associated with any subscriptions, and you have at least one alternate payment method on file, first change the payment method used to pay for the subscriptions. Then you can delete the payment method.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills & payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2018806" target="_blank">Payment methods</a> page.
2. Hover over the card or bank account, then select the delete icon.
3. The **Delete payment method** pane lists existing subscriptions that use that payment method.
4. Select **Change payment method**.
5. Select an alternate payment method from the drop-down list, then select **Change**.
    > [!WARNING]
    > This will move all subscriptions to the alternate payment method.
6. Select **Delete**.

### Change the payment method for a billing profile

If your payment method is associated with a billing profile and isn't also used to directly pay for other subscriptions, first change the payment method associated with it. Then you can delete the payment method.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > **Bills &amp; payments** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2103629" target="_blank">Billing profiles</a> page.
2. Select the billing profile you want to update.
3. On the billing profile details page, under **Payment method**, select **Edit**.
4. If you add an alternate payment method, select **Add a payment method**. Enter your account information, then select **Add**.
5. From the **Select a payment method** drop-down, select a different payment method, then select **Save**.
6. Follow the steps in [Delete a payment method](#delete-a-payment-method).

### Change the payment method used for both a billing profile and subscriptions

If your payment method is associated with a billing profile and is also used to directly pay for any subscriptions, first change the payment method associated with the billing profile. Next, change the payment method used to pay for the subscriptions. Then you can delete the payment method.

1. Follow steps 1 through 5 in [Change the payment method for a billing profile](#change-the-payment-method-for-a-billing-profile).
2. If you have no alternate payment method, follow the steps in [Add an alternate payment method used to pay for subscriptions](#add-an-alternate-payment-method-used-to-pay-for-subscriptions).
3. If you already have other payment methods available, follow the steps in [Change a payment method](#change-a-payment-method).

## Troubleshoot payment methods

|**Issue**|**Troubleshooting steps**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**I get an error message that says, "The browser is currently set to block cookies."** <br/> |Set your browser to allow third-party cookies and try again.  <br/> |
|**My credit or debit card was declined.** <br/> |If you pay by credit or debit card, and your card is declined, you receive an email that says Microsoft was unable to process the payment. Double-check that the card details &mdash; card number, expiration date, name on the card, and address, including city, state, and ZIP code — appear exactly as they do on the card and your statement. You can update your card information and immediately submit the payment by using the **Settle balance** link in the **Billing** section of the subscription details page. For more information, see [What if my credit card was declined and my payment is past due?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-my-credit-card-was-declined-and-my-payment-is-past-due).  <br/><br/>  If you continue to see the "declined" message, contact your bank. It's possible that your card isn't active. If you recently received the card in the mail with an updated expiration date, make sure it's activated. Your bank can also tell you whether your card isn't approved for online, international, or recurring transactions.  <br/> |
|**I want to update a card or bank account number.** <br/> |You can't change the number on an existing card or bank account. If your card or bank account number has changed, add another card number or bank account. Next, move any active subscriptions from the old card or account to the new one. Then delete the old card or account. For more information, see [Add a payment method](#add-a-payment-method) or [Change a payment method](#change-a-payment-method). |
|**I only have one card or bank account on my account and I want to remove it.** <br/> |If you only have one card or bank account, you see an error message when you try to remove it. To fix the error, make sure that you're using a different payment method to pay for all your subscriptions, then try removing the card or bank account again.  <br/> |
|**I can't add my card or bank account.** <br/> |If you have trouble entering your card or bank account information, you can [contact support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).  <br/> |
