# View your bill or invoice

This article is for people who have an Office 365 for business subscription. You must be a Global Admin or Billing Admin to do the steps described in this article.
  
If you need help interpreting the charges you see on your bill, see [Understand your invoice](understand-your-invoice.md) for a detailed walkthrough.
  
 **Not an admin?** Contact your IT administrator for help. 
  
 **Have a problem with your bill?** [Contact support for business products](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).
  
## View a bill or invoice

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848039" target="_blank">Bills</a> page.

    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848040" target="_blank">Bills</a> page.

2. Pick a date range from the drop down, then choose **View**.
  
3. Find the order you want to view, and then choose **View Details**.

4. On the **Bill Details** page, you can see the following:

  - The total balance, the current amount due, the payment due date, the amount of the last payment, and the date it was received.

  - Payment instructions.

  - A record of past payment dates, and the amounts paid.

  - The order creation date, and the order number.

5. To view the invoice for a specific month, in the **Invoice** section, choose a month and a year, then choose **Show**.

6. To print or save a PDF copy of the invoice, choose **View invoice (.pdf)**.

## Stop receiving a copy of my billing statement in email

By default, you will receive a copy of your billing statement as an email attachment. You can choose to stop receiving a copy by email.
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853212" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.

    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853213" target="_blank">Billing notifications</a> page.
