# Buy a subscription to Office 365 for business from your free trial

You've tried Office 365, and now you're ready to buy. You have two options when buying Office 365 from your trial version:
  
- [Buy the same plan as your trial](#buy-the-same-plan-as-your-trial)
- [Buy a different plan than your trial](#buy-a-different-plan-than-your-trial)

## Buy the same plan as your trial

It's easy, and, when you buy the same type of subscription as your trial version, you don't have to worry about losing your data, accounts, and configuration.

## Buy a different plan than your trial

If you purchase a different type of subscription that your trial, you will have to reassign your user licenses from your trial plan to your new plan (before your 90-day grace period ends after your trial plan expires) in order to retain your data, accounts, and configuration.
