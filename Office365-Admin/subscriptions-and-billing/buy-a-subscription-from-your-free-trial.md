# Buy a subscription to Office 365 for business from your free trial

You've tried Office 365, and now you're ready to buy. You have two options when buying Office 365 from your trial version:
  
- [Buy the same plan as your trial](#buy-the-same-plan-as-your-trial)
- [Buy a different plan than your trial](#buy-a-different-plan-than-your-trial)

## Buy the same plan as your trial

It's easy, and, when you buy the same type of subscription as your trial version, you don't have to worry about losing your data, accounts, and configuration.

### Use the new admin center to buy the same plan as your trial

The new admin center is available to all Microsoft 365 admins. You can opt in by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page. For more information, see [About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page.

2. On the **Products & services** page, find the subscription that you want to buy. In the **Licenses** section, choose **Purchase subscription**.
