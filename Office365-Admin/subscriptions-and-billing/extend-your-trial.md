# Extend your trial for Office 365 for business

Do you need more time to try out the features of Office 365 for business before buying? If your trial subscription is within 15 days of expiring and the trial hasn't been extended before then you can extend your trial for another 30 day period. You can only do this one time.
  
1. In the Admin center, go to the [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054) page, or choose **Billing** \> **Subscriptions**.
    
    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=847745) page. 
    
    If you're using Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, go to this [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850626) page. 
    
2. On the **Subscriptions** page, select the trial subscription that you want to extend and then choose **Extend trial**.
