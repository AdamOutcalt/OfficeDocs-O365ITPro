# Remove licenses from your Office 365 for business subscription

You can't remove a license from a subscription if it's assigned to a user. If you want to remove a license that is currently assigned to someone, you'll need to [remove the license from the user](remove-licenses-from-users.md) before you can remove the license from the subscription.

## What if I don't see the Add/Remove licenses link?

This section describes the reasons why the **Add/Remove licenses** link might not be available, and what you can do about it.
  
### A credit check is pending

If a credit check is pending, you'll see a "Pending credit check" message, and you won't be able to remove licenses until the credit check is completed. If a credit check is pending, check back later to see if the credit check has completed. Credit checks typically take up to two working days to complete.
  
After the credit check is complete, you should see the **Add/Remove licenses** link in the **Users** section. If so, go to [Remove licenses from your Office 365 for business subscription](#remove-licenses-from-your-office-365-for-business-subscription).
  
### You activated the subscription using a product key

If the subscription was purchased and activated using a 25-character product key product key, you'll see the text "Prepaid". If your subscription was prepaid using a product key, you can't remove licenses because they have already been paid for. However, you can remove the extra licenses when you renew the subscription.
  
### You bought your subscription through a partner

If your subscription was purchased through a CSP or partner, you canâ€™t remove licenses. Contact your CSP or use the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) link to contact your partner for help.
