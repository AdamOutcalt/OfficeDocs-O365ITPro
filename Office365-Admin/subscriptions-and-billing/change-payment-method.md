When you buy Office 365 for business, you choose to pay by credit card or bank account, pay by invoice, or pay by using a prepaid product key. You can switch between paying by credit card or bank account and paying by invoice at any time during your subscription. If you paid using a prepaid product key, you can choose to switch over to paying by credit card or bank account, or to paying by invoice after your licensing period has ended. After you switch payment methods, your users will continue to have the same license assignments as before.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Paying by using a bank account is not available in Japan.

 **Just want to change your credit card or bank account information?** See [Add, update, or remove a credit card or bank account in Office 365 for business](add-update-or-remove-credit-card-or-bank-account.md).
  
 **What if I have an outstanding balance?**
  
If you're moving from *invoice to credit card or bank account*, your existing invoice charges won't be transferred to your credit card or bank account, so be sure to pay any outstanding invoice balance by wire transfer. In some regions, you can also pay your outstanding balance by check. See your invoice for more information about paying your outstanding balance.
  
If you're moving from *credit card or bank account to invoice*, any outstanding balance will be transferred to your next invoice.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you pay by credit card, and your credit card is declined, you'll receive an email letting you know that we were unable to process the payment. You can update your credit card information and immediately submit the payment by using the **Pay now** button on the **Subscriptions** page. For more information, see [What if my credit card was declined and my payment is past due?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-my-credit-card-was-declined-and-my-payment-is-past-due)

## Change from invoice to credit card or bank account

> [!TIP]
> The following steps apply to individual subscriptions only. If you have multiple subscriptions in your organization, complete these steps for each subscription that you want to change.
  
When you change from paying by invoice to paying by credit card or bank account, we automatically create a new subscription for you, move your users to the new subscription, and then disable your old subscription. Don't worry, your users won't see a disruption in service and all of their information will be available through the new subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot use the admin center (preview) to change from invoice to credit card or bank account.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing**\> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page.

2. Find the subscription that you want to change. In the **Payment details** section, choose **Change payment details**.
  
3. In the **Change payment details** pane, choose **Change your payment method**.
  
4. In the **Change your payment method** dialog box, choose **Continue**.
  
5. On the **How does this look?** page, you can optionally increase the number of users licenses that you want for this subscription. To continue, choose **Next**.

6. Some subscriptions have the option to choose a monthly or annual commitment. If you see a choice to pay by the year or by the month on the **How do you want to pay?** page, choose how frequently you want to pay.
  
7. In the **Payment method** list, choose either **Existing card**, **New credit card**, or **New bank account**.
  
8. If you chose the **New credit card** or **New bank account** option in step 9, fill out the rest of your payment information.

9. When you're done filling out the form, choose **Place order**.

When you return to the **Subscriptions** page, you will see the old subscription marked **Disabled** and the new one marked **Active**. You can let the old subscription expire.
