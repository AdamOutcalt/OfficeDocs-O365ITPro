# Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business
  
## Assign licenses to multiple users

### Use the old Admin center to assign licenses to multiple users
  
1. In the Admin center, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page, or select **Users** \> **Active users**.
    
    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=847686" target="_blank">Active users</a> page. 
    
    If you're using Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850628" target="_blank">Active users</a> page. 
    
2. Select the boxes next to the names of the users to whom you want to assign licenses.
    
3. In the **Bulk actions** pane, select **Edit product licenses**.
    
4. In the **Assign products** pane, select **Add to existing product license assignments** \> **Next**.
    
5. Switch the toggle to the **On** position for the license that you want the selected users to have. 
    
    By default, all services associated with that license are automatically assigned to the users. To limit which services are available to the users, switch the toggles to the **Off** position for the services that you don't want the users to have. 
    
6. At the bottom of the **Add to existing products** pane, select **Add** \> **Close** \> **Close**.
