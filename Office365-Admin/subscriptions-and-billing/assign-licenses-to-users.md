# Assign licenses to users

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"
You can assign licenses to users on either the **Active users** page, or on the **Licenses** page. Which method you use depends on whether you want to assign product licenses to specific users, or assign users licenses to specific products.

## Assign licenses to users on the Licenses page

When you use the **Licenses** page to assign licenses, you assign licenses for a specific product to up to 20 users. When you view the **Licenses** page, you see a list of all the products for which you have subscriptions, together with the total number of licenses for each product, how many licenses are assigned, and how many are available.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a>  page.
2. Select a product for which you want to assign licenses.
3. Select **Assign licenses**.
4. In the **Assign licenses to users** pane, begin typing a name, and then choose it from the results to add it to the list. You can add up to 20 users at a time.
5. Select **Turn apps and services on or off** to assign or remove access to specific items.
6. When youâ€™re finished, select **Assign**, then select **Close**.

If there is a conflict, a message displays, tells you what the problem is, and how to fix it. For example, if you selected licenses that contain conflicting services, the error message says to review the services included with each license and try again.

To change the apps and services to which a user has access:

1. Select the row that contains the user. 
2. In the right pane, select or deselect the apps and services to which you want to give or remove access. 
3. When you are finished, select **Save**, then select **Close**.
