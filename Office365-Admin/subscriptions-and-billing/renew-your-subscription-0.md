# Renew Office 365 for business

This article applies to most paid Office 365 for business subscriptions.
  
To renew by using a product key that you bought from a retail store or Office 365 partner, see [Find and enter your product key for Office 365 for business](../misc/enter-your-product-key.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Paying by bank account isn't available in some countries or regions. 
  
## Turn Recurring billing on or off
<a name="BKMK_Renew"> </a>

If you pay by credit card or bank account, **Recurring billing** is turned on by default. When **Recurring billing** is on, your subscription will continue to be billed each year on the day you subscribed. You can turn it off or back on again in the Office 365 admin center if your subscription is active. 
  
If you prepaid for your subscription with a product key, your subscription will expire at the end of subscription term. You can turn on **Recurring billing** and provide credit card or bank account information so that your subscription will continue to be billed every year on the day you subscribed. You also have the option to pay every month, or to pay for the entire year up front. Your credit card or bank account will not be charged until your initial subscription term has expired. 
  
1. In the Admin center, go to the [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054) page, or choose **Billing** \> **Subscriptions**.
    
    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=847745) page. 
    
    If you're using Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, go to this [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850626) page. 
    
2. To turn on **Recurring billing**, switch the toggle to **On**.

    You can turn off **Recurring billing** by switching the toggle to **Off**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can only change the **Recurring billing** setting for active subscriptions. If your subscription has already expired or is disabled, you will need to [reactivate it](reactivate-your-subscription.md) before you can turn **Recurring billing** on or off. >  When **Recurring billing** is turned off, the subscription isn't cancelled right away. It remains active until it expires. You can view the expiration date on the subscription card, as shown below. >  To learn how to cancel the subscription right away, see [Cancel my subscription](cancel-your-subscription.md).
