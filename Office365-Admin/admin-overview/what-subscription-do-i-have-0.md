# What subscription do I have?

If you're an admin, you can verify which subscriptions your organization has by going to the **Subscriptions** page in the admin center. 
  
 **Not an admin?** See [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.office.com/article/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd.aspx)
  
1. In the Admin center, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page, or choose **Billing** \> **Subscriptions**.
    
    ::: moniker range="o365-germany"
   
    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this [Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=847745) page. 

    ::: moniker-end

    ::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"
    
    If you're using Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850626" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page. 
    
    ::: moniker-end

2. If you have only one subscription, it will be displayed on the **Subscriptions** page, along with the subscription name, information about the subscription, and its status. In the following screenshot, you can see that I have an Office 365 Business subscription.

3. If you have multiple subscriptions, you'll see a column next to the detailed subscription information that lists the subscriptions that have been purchased, as well as any trial subscriptions. By default, the subscription at the top of the list is automatically selected, and the detailed information for that subscription is shown.
    
    If you have multiple subscriptions, select the one you want to see detailed information for. The subscription card will update with information about that subscription.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have subscriptions that have expired or have been disabled, they'll be listed based on their current state.
