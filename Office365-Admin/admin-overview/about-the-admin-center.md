# About the Microsoft 365 admin center

[![Label to let you know the admin center is changing and you can find more details at aka.ms/aboutM365preview.](../media/O365-Admin-AdminCenterChanging.png)](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md)

**If you purchased an Office 365 business plan AND you have admin permissions, you have access to the admin center**. This article is for you! 

**If you are a user or have an Office 365 home plan, you do not have an admin center.** To set up Office 365, go to [Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2016 on a PC or Mac](https://support.office.com/article/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658.aspx).

You use the admin center to set up your organization in the cloud, manage users, manage subscriptions, and much more. In this article, learn how to get to the admin center and learn about available features and settings.

## How to get to the admin center

1. Sign in at [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) with your admin account.
    
    ::: moniker range="o365-germany"

    If you're using Office 365 Germany, <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041" target="_blank">sign in here</a> with your admin account. 

    ::: moniker-end

    ::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

    If you're using Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627" target="_blank">sign in to Office 365 operated by 21Vianet</a> with your admin account.

    ::: moniker-end

2. Select the app launcher icon ![Office 365 app launcher icon](../media/0aaa6945-f9a4-4b13-bf5f-d5c5dbe978fb.png) in the upper-left and choose **Admin**.
    
    The **Admin** tile appears only to people who have Office 365 [admin permissions](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md). If you don't see the tile, then you don't have permissions to access the admin center for your organization.
