## You'll be asked for the following information when you sign up for Office 365 for business
<a name="__top"> </a>

- **The address and contact information for your subscription:**
    
  - **Country** where the services will be used. You **won't** be able to change this later, even during the sign up process; you'll have to re-start the sign up wizard. 
    
  - **Email** and **phone number** so we can contact you if needed about your subscription. For example, if you forget your password, we would use this information to send you a temporary one. We also send your billing information to the email address you specify. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The email address you enter here is different from your Office 365 email address (your logon name, below). Because this is where we also send your billing information, we recommend you use an e-mail address that's appropriate for receiving business email. 
  
- **A sign-in name (user ID):** This becomes your initial Office 365 email address, just to get you started quickly. 
    
    This is the email address you use to sign in to Office 365. For example, if your business name is Fourth Coffee, you might choose rob@fourthcoffee.onmicrosoft.com for your user ID.
    
    Most people add their own custom domain to Office 365 shortly after they sign up so they can start getting email to it. For example, if you have a custom domain named fourthcoffee.com, you can set up your email address as rob@fourthcoffee.com.
    
- **Payment information:**
    
    You can pay for your Office 365 subscription with a credit card. If the cost reaches a certain amount, you may also have the option to pay by invoice.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  When you sign up for Office 365, be sure to choose the best payment option for your organization. Changing payment options involves calling billing support.
