# What are the many ways Help is available in the Microsoft 365 admin center?

Sometimes you'll need to do something in the admin center but you aren't sure how to get it done.  We've got your back!  Help is available in the Microsoft 365 admin center at various points and in different ways for just these situations.  

For example, if you need help understanding some text, there are tooltips and help bubbles. And if you want more information about something, there are links to articles. If you aren't sure how to get something done or where to start, click the “Need Help” button in the lower right corner of the admin center and enter a query. You'll get self-help in the form of intelligent insights based on what has helped other customers who've entered the a similar query.  Or, if your prefer,you can use our virtual assistant and engage in a conversational chat to get help. 



## Help bubbles
Help bubbles provide on-the-spot help if you encounter potentially unfamiliar concepts or need additional information about a setting (such as user impact or effect of different values). If needed, bubbles also include links to additional content.

In this example, a help bubble is used in the New Group wizard to provide detailed information about each of type of group so you can decide which one best suits your needs.

## Links to documentation
Links provide a quick pathway to official help content. Rather than interrupt your workflow by forcing you to hunt online for answers, links take you to articles based on the page you're currently using. You can discover more about a feature or the learn about the ramifications of a specific setting.

In this example, as you complete a recommendation to set up sensitivity labels, the link “Show me where these labels appear” takes you to [this document](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2005245) so you can learn where the labels will appear to your users.

## Toolboxes
Toolboxes provide an aggregated list of tasks related to managing a larger scenario. Each entry includes a description of the task and links directly to the in-app feature where that task is performed.

In this example, the GDPR Toolbox in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center provides links to features that will help you discover, govern, protect, and monitor the personal data in the organization (all common requirements for GDPR compliance).

## Microsft 365 "Need Help" pane
Clicking the "Need Help" button in the Microsoft 365 admin center opens a search box where you can insert a query.

In this example, we searched for *verify my domain*. 
The help pane returned an Insight card and a few articles we think will help you.  The insight is powered by Machine Learning that helps us surface a solution that has been helpful to other admins who have entered similar queries.

## Chatbot: A virtual assistant

For those times when you don't quite know how to get something done in your specific situation, try out the O365 Assistant. Just click the toggle at the top of the "Need Help" pane to turn it on. 

The O365 Assistant is a chatbot that provides a conversational interface for getting help. Enter your query and the chatbot will ask clarifying questions to get you to the right answer for your specific situation.  Think of it as your virtual helper to discover solutions and complete tasks. 

For example, if I enter "reset password" the chatbot asks me questions about whether I want to reset my own password or someone else's.
