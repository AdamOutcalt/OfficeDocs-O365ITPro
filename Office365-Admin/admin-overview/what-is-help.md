# What are the many ways Help is available in the Microsoft 365 admin center?

We've tried to design the admin center so you can complete a task quickly. But sometimes it just isn't clear how to get something done. For those situations, we've got your back! We provide tips throughout the admin center, as well as a intelligent assistance to answer your questions.

## Integrated help
Help is integrated throughout the admin center so it's right there when you need it.

The above image shows three types of help in the admin center:  

1. **Inline help text**. Relays info critical to the task at hand. 
2. **Link to article**. Provides a quick pathway to official documentation so you can learn more. 
3. **Help bubble**. Provides on-the-spot help if you encounter potentially unfamiliar concepts or need additional information about a setting (such as the effect of different values). If needed, help bubbles also include links to additional content.

## Modern self-help powered by AI

Clicking the "Need Help" button in the Microsoft 365 admin center opens our modern self-help experience powered by artificial intelligence. For example, if you search for *verify my domain* 
you'll get the steps plus few articles we think will help you.  This is powered by machine learning that helps us surface a solution that has been helpful to other admins who have entered similar queries. 

Or, for those times when you don't quite know how to get something done in your specific situation, use the O365 Assistant. Just click the toggle at the top of the "Need Help" pane to turn it on. The O365 Assistant provides a conversational interface for getting help. Enter your query and the chatbot will ask clarifying questions to get you to the right answer for your specific situation.  Think of it as your virtual helper to discover solutions and complete tasks.
