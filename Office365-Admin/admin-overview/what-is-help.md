# What is Help?

## In-app help
### Help bubbles
Help bubbles provide on-the-spot help as users encounter potentially unfamiliar concepts or need additional information about a setting (such as user impact or effect of different values). If needed, bubbles also include links to additional content.

In this example, a help bubble is used in the New Group wizard to provide detailed information about each of the group types to help the user decide which best suits their needs.

### Context-sensitive help links to documentation
Context-sensitive help (CSH) links provide a quick pathway to official help content. Rather than interrupt their workflow by forcing them to hunt online for answers, CSH links deliver relevant help content based on the UX that the user is currently interacting with, whether it be to discover more about a feature or the learn about the ramifications of a specific setting.

In this example, as users complete a recommendation to set up sensitivity labels in their organization, the CSH link “Show me where these labels appear” takes them to [this document](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2005245) to give customers insight into where the labels will appear to their users.

### Toolboxes
Toolboxes provide users with an aggregated list of tasks related to managing a larger scenario. Each entry includes a description of the task and links directly to the in-app feature where that task is performed.

In this example, the GDPR Toolbox in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center provides links to features that will help customers discover, govern, protect, and monitor the personal data in the organization (all common requirements for GDPR compliance).

## M365 "Need Help" pane
Clicking the "Need Help" button in the M365 Admin Center opens a search box where you can describe a issue you're having or search for help articles.

In this example, we searched for *verify my domain*. 
The help pane returned an Insight card and a few articles we think will help you.
