# What is Help?

## M365 "Need Help" pane
Clicking the "Need Help" button in the M365 Admin Center opens a search box where you can describe a issue you're having or search for help articles.

In this example, we searched for *verify my domain*. 
The help pane returned an Insight card and a few articles we think will help you.
