- Get service health and change notifications
- Create a service request
- Reset a user's password
- Assign licenses
- Add or remove group memberships
- Add users 

And if you're someone who is responsible for more than one online organization, you sign in to multiple orgs and quickly switch between them.

## Frequently asked questions

Below are answers to some frequently asked questions people ask about the app.
  
### What do I need to do to be able to use the app?

You need to have a valid Office 365 for business or Microsoft 365 Business subscription with admin privileges to sign in and use the app. The Admin mobile app isn't an email client. It's a rich administrative app with over 80 features to help you support your org while your on the go.
  
### Can I use the app with my Office 365 for home subscription?

No, the app only works with Office 365 for business and Microsoft 365 Business subscriptions. 
  
### Will the app work if my organization has directory synchronization enabled?

Yes, but with reduced functionality. You'll be able to sign in and view service information, but most of the user management functions will be read-only. You won't be able to add, edit, or delete users. However, you'll be able to assign licenses to users in your organization, and get notifications.
  
### What languages are supported by the app?

The app supports all 39 languages that the web-based Microsoft 365 admin center supports. 
  
### Why does the Messages tile on the Home screen show numbers even after I've read the new messages?

The numbers are the total messages from the last week, not unread messages.
  
### How can I share the Service Incidents and Messages with the rest of my organization?

If you click a specific service incident or a message, the share option will be in the top right corner. We currently support email sharing.
  
### My app is acting funny. What can I do to troubleshoot weird app behavior?

You can try some common mobile app troubleshooting steps:
  
1. Close and reopen the app.
    
2. Uninstall and reinstall the app.

3. If that doesn't work, you can email us at [feedback365@microsoft.com](mailto:feedback365@microsoft.com) to let us know.
