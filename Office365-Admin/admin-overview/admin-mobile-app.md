## Frequently asked questions

Below are answers to some frequently asked questions people ask about the app.
  
## What do I need to do to be able to use the app?

You must have a valid Office 365 Business subscription with admin privileges to sign in and use the app. The Admin mobile app isn't an email client.
  
## Can I use the app with my Office 365 for home subscription?

No, the app only works with Office 365 for business plans. 
  
> [!TIP]
> If you're not sure which plan you have, see [Office for home and Office for business plans](https://support.office.com/article/28cbc8cf-1332-4f04-9123-9b660abb629e.aspx). 
  
## Will the app work if my organization has directory synchronization enabled?

The app will work with reduced functionality. You'll be able to sign in and view service information, but most of the user management functions will be read-only. You won't be able to add, edit, or delete users. However, you'll be able to assign licenses to users in your organization.
  
## What languages are supported by the app?

The app is available in English, Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, and Traditional Chinese.
  
## Why does the Messages tile on the Home screen show numbers even after I've read the new messages?

The numbers are the total messages from the last week, not unread messages.
  
## How can I share the Service Incidents and Messages with the rest of my organization?

If you click a specific service incident or a message, the share option will be in the top right corner. We currently support email sharing.
  
## My app is acting funny. What can I do to troubleshoot weird app behavior?

You can try some common mobile app troubleshooting steps:
  
1. Close and reopen the app.
    
2. Uninstall and reinstall the app.
    
## How do I access beta features in the mobile app?

We release beta features to the app for feedback to gauge how we can improve them before releasing worldwide. You can check out beta features by doing the following:
