# Find your Office 365 partner or reseller

 **Not sure if Open Volume Licensing is for you?** Check out the [Microsoft Open Programs overview](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=613298).

As a best practice, we recommend contacting the person or department responsible for purchasing in your organization to find out which partner you should work with. 
  
## Get partner info in the admin center

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account as a global admin. [Where to sign in to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4).
    
2. Select the app launcher icon  in the upper-left and then choose **Admin**.
    
    Can't find the app you're looking for? From the app launcher, select **All apps** to see an alphabetical list of the Office 365 apps available to you. From there, you can search for a specific app. 
    
3. Go to **Settings** \> **Partner relationships**.
