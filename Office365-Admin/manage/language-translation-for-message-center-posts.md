# Language translation for Message center posts

Message center posts are written in English-only due to the timeliness of the information we are posting, but can be automatically displayed in the language specified by your personal language settings for Office 365. If you set your preferred language to anything other than English, you'll see an option in Message center to automatically translate posts. The messages will be machine translated to your preferred language, meaning that a computer did the translation. This option controls the default view, but you can also use the drop-down menu to translate and display posts in any of the languages we support for translation. If you select English, we'll revert the message to the original English version.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can choose your language settings for Message center, you have to set your preferred language for Office 365. No translation options are shown when your language is set to English. You can't specify a preferred language for others, each person has to change this setting for themselves. 
  
## Set your preferred language

1. From the Office 365 admin center or home page, select the settings icon in the upper-right corner of the window.<br/>![Settings panel](../media/94f50d9b-e6ce-4a52-b6b1-8ddc55d2a859.PNG)
  
2. Expand **Language and time zone** to show the available options. Select your desired language from the drop-down menu, then click **Save**. Office 365 will try to refresh and display the new language. If that doesn't happen immediately or if it seems that it's taking too long, you can either refresh your browser or sign out and then sign back in.<br/>![Language preference settings](../media/31a3ade3-e25b-44da-b302-3107d8573b50.png)
  
## Machine translation in Message center

When your preferred language is not set to English, the translation options in Message center are available.
  
To set Message center posts to automatically machine-translate and display in your preferred language, go to **Health** \> **Message center**. You'll see a switch at the top of the message list view to toggle automatic translation on or off. When this setting is off, posts are shown in English. When this setting is on, messages display in your preferred language. The setting you choose will persist for each visit to Message center.

Whether the automatic translation setting is on or off, you can manually change the displayed language to another language. In this example, the preferred language is Deutsch (Deutschland) and posts are set to automatically translate and display in that language. Translate to English is selected from the drop-down, so posts display in the original English version.

This language setting will persist while you're active in Message center, but will revert to your default language settings when you navigate away from Message center.
