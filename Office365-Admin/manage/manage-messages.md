# Manage messages in Message center

[![Label to let you know the admin center is changing and you can find more details at aka.ms/aboutM365preview.](../media/O365-Admin-AdminCenterChanging.png)](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md)

Message center posts are important announcements about new and changed features. This article provides more information about the things you can do with messages to help with change management in your organization.
  
## Read a message

To go to the Message center, go to the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), and select **Health** > **Message center**. 

Select a message title to open it in the reading pane. Every message contains a summary of the change, a statement of how the change may affect you, information about how you can prepare your organization for the change, and (in most cases) an additional information link where you can learn more. The additional information continues to be available, even after a message expires.
  
## Filter and sort

### Use the new admin center to filter and sort

The new admin center is available to all Microsoft 365 admins. You can opt in by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page. For more information, see [About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md).

Use the **Filter** drop-down menu to select a filtered view of messages.

You can select any column heading to sort messages in ascending or descending order. For example, in this diagram the messages are sorted on the **Act by** date.

## Give feedback on a post

In the Message center, you can select a message to see details.

If you want to provide feedback on the message, select either the **Like** or **Dislike** icon and provide feedback in the text box that appears. Do not provide any personal information. You can optionally select **It's OK to contact me about this feedback** and then select **Send**.

## Share a message

See a message that someone else needs to act on? You can share the contents of the message with any user by email:
  
1. Select the message to open it, and then select **Share**.
  
2. To share the message, enter up to two email addresses separated by a colon. You can send to individual and to group email addresses. Optionally, you can choose to receive a copy of the message in email (the message will go to your primary email address in Office 365) or add a personal message to provide recipients with more context.
  
3. Select **Share** to send the email.
    
## Get a link

Need to follow up with another admin to make sure they're aware of a change and taking action? You can generate a link to share in email or instant messaging, for example, that will connect the user directly to that message. The person you share the link with has to be an admin in Office 365 for your organization or they won't have access to the linked message.
