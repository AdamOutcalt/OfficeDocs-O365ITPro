# Idle timeout session

Idle session timeout provides an Office 365 administrator to configure a threshold at which a user is warned and subsequently signed out of SharePoint or OneDrive after a period of inactivity as illustrated below.

As an Office 365 admin, you can configure an idle timeout setting that automatically signs users of the online Office apps when they’ve been inactive​. You can control how long that inactive period is.
  
## Configure idle session timeout

1. Go to the [![Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center](../media/e00ba917-c3fb-4173-b344-43eb5c7eeb15.png)](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/homepage).

2. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** \> **Security and privacy**. If you aren't an Office 365 global admin, you won't see the Security and privacy option.
  
3. Next to **Idle Session Timeout** choose **Edit**.
  
4. On the **Idle Session Timeout** select the toggle to turn it on. You can choose a default setting or choose your own custom time.

Once a user reaches the idle timeout session when they're using the online Office apps, they'll get a notification that they're about to be signed out. If they don't stay signed out, they'll be automatically signed out of all online Office apps that they're using.
