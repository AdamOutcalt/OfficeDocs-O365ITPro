# Office 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Office activations

The Office 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. Check out [the Reports overview topic](activity-reports.md).
  
The Office Activation report gives you a view of which users have activated their Office subscription on at least one device. It provides a breakdown of the Office 365 Proplus, Project, and Visio Pro for Office 365 subscription activations, as well as the breakdown of activations across desktop and devices. This report could be useful in helping you identify users that might need additional help and support to activate their Office subscription.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator in Office 365 or an Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business administrator, or reports reader to see reports.

|1  <br/> |The Office Activations report presents the current state of the office license activations data [as of the date of the report presented on the top right of the chart].  <br/> |
|2  <br/> |Each report has a date for when this report was generated. The reports usually reflect a 24 to 48 hour latency from time of activity.  <br/> |
|3  <br/> |The **Activations** chart shows you the count of Office activations on desktops and devices.  <br/> |
|4  <br/> |The **Users** chart shows you the count of users that are enabled, and users that have activated the Office subscription on desktop or devices..  <br/> |
|5  <br/> | On the **Activations** chart, the Y axis is the count of Office activations.  <br/>  On the **Users** chart, the Y axis is the user's performing activity of activating Office.  <br/>  The X axis on both charts is the selected date range for this specific report.  <br/> |
|6  <br/> |You can filter charts you see by clicking on an item in the legend. For example, on the **Activations** chart, click or tap **Windows OS**, **Mac OS**, **Windows 10 mobile**, **iOS** or **Android** to see only the info related to each one. Changing this selection doesn't change the info in the grid table. <br/> ![Activation data for devices](../media/59d3ec6e-2a6e-4b21-8aac-c73038c47b9f.png)  <br/> |
