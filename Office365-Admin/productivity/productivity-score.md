# Microsoft Productivity score (Preview)

Microsoft 365 offers productivity solutions that enables your organization to meet its business goals. Productivity Score provides insights to use these solutions that you can transform to how work gets done. It contains: 

- **Visibility** by helping them understand how people work in the form of their current score with breakdown across categories of Employee experience and Technology experience (coming soon). 
- **Insights** to identify opportunities to enable improved experiences. 
- **Actions** to update skills and systems so everyone can do their best work. 

The score and the insights are present across two categories –  

- **Employee experience:** shows how Microsoft 365 is helping to create a productive and engaged workforce by quantifying how people collaborate on content, work anywhere, by understanding communication styles (coming soon), and by developing a meeting culture (coming soon) 

- **Technology experience** (coming soon): Assists you to optimize your device experiences such as proactively fixing common helpdesk issues,  and improving PC startup times and your network to ensure your apps work well.  

## How it works

### Areas of scoring 

Within each score category, Productivity Score provides insights on your work transformation across areas. The areas covered within Employee experience are:

- Collaborating on content  
- Working anywhere 
- Understanding communication styles (coming soon) 
- Developing a meeting culture (coming soon) 

### Scoring user actions 

Within each area, we measure the research-based key actions which represent the ways of working that enable organizations to transform into highly productive organization. For each area we compute the % of users who perform these actions within the last 28 days. 

The Employee experience score is curated as an average score across all areas. Note that we will keep adding more areas to Employee experience and Technology experience over time. 

### Products included in the Productivity Score 

Productivity Score currently includes signals from the key Microsoft 365 workloads OneDrive, SharePoint, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Yammer, Teams, Skype. 

Your score is updated daily and reflects user actions completed in the last 28 days (including the current day).
