# Microsoft Productivity score (Private preview)

Productivity Score gives you insights that transform how work gets done. It will provide you visibility into how your organization works, insights that identify where you can enable improved experiences so people can reach their goals, and actions to update skills and systems so everyone can do their best work.  Let’s dive into each of these areas in more detail starting with visibility into how your organization works.

Productivity Score provides organizations: 

- **Visibility** by helping them understand how they work. 
- **Insights** to identify opportunities to enable improved experiences. 
- **Actions** to update skills and systems so everyone can do their best work. 
- **Benchmarks** to compare their ways of working with similar organizations.

## How it works

Microsoft 365 enables you to work productively in areas such as communicating with others and collaborating on content. Each of these areas has key actions from the users that represent the cross-suite capabilities in these areas and are also associated with higher value derived that is inferred from user engagement. Each user gets points for completing these key actions within a given time period. These points are then aggregated to provide the productivity posture score at an organization level. 

Your score is updated daily and reflects user actions completed in the last 28 days (including the current day).

### How user actions are scored 

For each of the score areas, there are certain user actions/outcomes that are scored. Over a 28-day period, we look at the frequency of these actions to quantify the typical user behavior and thus attach a score to them.

### Apps included in the Productivity Score 

Productivity Score currently includes signals from the key Microsoft 365 apps including OneDrive, SharePoint, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook.

## Access and required permissions 

For the employee experience, you must have a subscription to an Office 365 for business plan or a Microsoft 365 Business plan with multiple users. 

To have permission to access Microsoft Productivity Score, you must have of the following roles: 

- Global Admin 
- Global Reader 

You can access the experience from Microsoft 365 Admin home by choosing **Reports** > **Productivity Score** in the left navigation.

## Using Productivity Score

One of the most noticeable ways we help you see how you are transforming how work gets done is via the score on the Productivity Score home page. The score is on a percentage basis. Currently, the employee experience is the category that is being scored.  The employee experience shows how Microsoft 365 is helping to create a productive and engaged workforce by quantifying how people collaborate on content and work from anywhere.

### Insights to identify opportunities to improve experiences 

Within employee experience there are three different types of insights.

- Primary insight: This is what you see on the home page and at the top of the details page for an area.  What we are measuring in this insight is what will directly impact the score.   
- Academic insight: This helps you understand the correlation of what we are measuring in the primary insight to productivity.  You will see these on the right side of the details page under the “Why it matters” header.  
- Supporting insight: This gives you contextual details around user activities within your organizations and associated actions that can drive the outcomes measured in the primary insight. 

### Actions for update skills and systems 

In order to promote actionability, each supporting insight comes with inline actions that can help transform your employee experience some of which can be configuration changes or awareness campaigns. Choosing these calls-to-action opens in the recommended actions panel as options that you might consider. 

### Compare your organization with other organizations 

To help you to understand how your score compares to other organizations, we provide you “Peer benchmark” scores that form the average of scores/measures within your cohort of similar organizations. Your cohort is composed of organizations who have similar number of paid seats, region, SKU mix, industry and tenure with Microsoft.
