 Office 365 helps you meet the compliance requirements to the HIPAA Security Rule by:
  
- Entering into a business associate agreement (BAA) with the covered entities for Office 365 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online. This agreement ascertains the adherence of the business associate (Microsoft) to the prescriptions and recommendations of HIPAA.
    
- Encrypting all data uploaded to or stored on Microsoft servers. Any data transferred outside Microsoft facilities is also similarly encrypted.
    
- Maintaining logs of all access requests for the stored data. Covered entities may request and obtain reports on access logs from Microsoft.
    
- Multi-factor authentication, which adds another layer of security over the traditional password based authentication. This prevents unfamiliar devices from logging in to an Office 365 or Outlook email account in the event of a password getting compromised.
