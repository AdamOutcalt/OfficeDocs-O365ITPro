# Office app for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

The Microsoft Office app combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app available for download for Android devices and iOS phones. With the Office app you can connect to Office 365 just as you would with the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps. The Office app download won't affect any existing installations of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

A few Office app features are not available for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet customers:
- Image to text and Image to table 
- Converting photos to word documents from Lens 
- Transfer files action 
- Notes will not sync to server and will remain local 
- Link preview within Scan QR 

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed the public preview of the Office app or the Office Mobile app for Samsung mobile devices, the Office app will update automatically with the most recent version of the app.

## Download the Office app

To download the Office app for Android and iOs:

- Download the Office app for Android phones and tablets from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehubrow). 
- Download the Office app for iPhones from the [App Store](https://products.office.com/en-us/mobile/office?rtc=2). (The Office app for iPad will be available later)

## Security considerations before you download the Office app

Before you download the Office app, protect your organization's data by enabling Intune protection policies. And, if your organization pushes apps to employee mobile devices, we suggest replacing the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps with the Office app.  

To ensure your data is protected by app protection policies, use these steps to enable Intune protection policies specifically for the Office app: 

- For Android App Protection Policies, add the Office, Office [HL], and Office [ROW] apps. 
- For iOS App Protection Policies, add the Office app. 

Review [how to target apps with your app protection policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/apps/app-protection-policies).
