# Office app for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet

The Microsoft Office app combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app available for download for Android devices and iOS phones. With the Office app you can connect to Office 365 just as you would with the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps. The Office app download won't affect any existing installations of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

A few Office app features are not available for Office 365 operated by 21Vianet customers:

- Image to text and Image to table 
- Converting photos to Word documents from Lens 
- Transfer files action 
- Notes remain local and do not sync to server
- Link preview within Scan QR
- Live persona cards in the Me section
- CLP

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed the public preview of the Office app or the Office Mobile app for Samsung mobile devices, the Office app updates automatically with the most recent version of the app.

## Download the Office app

To download the Office app for Android and iOs:

- Download the Office app for Android phones from these stores:
o	Huawei
o	Xiaomi
o	Lenovo
o	Baidu
o	OppO
o	Wandujia

- Download the Office app for iPhones from the [App Store](https://products.office.com/en-us/mobile/office?rtc=2).

## Security considerations

If your organization pushes apps to employee mobile devices, we suggest replacing the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps with the Office app.
