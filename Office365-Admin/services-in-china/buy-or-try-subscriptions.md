1. Go to [Compare Office 365 for business plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=393691&amp;clcid=0x409) and select the name of the plan you want to buy. Then, select **Buy now**.

2. Create an account by filling out the **Just a few details** page.

3. Follow the instructions to set up your 30-day trial or to complete your purchase.
