# Quick help: External users

If your organization shares documents or sites with vendors, clients, or customers, you can use the external sharing features of SharePoint Online. If you require people outside your organization to authenticate with their own work or school account, or with their Microsoft account, they'll be listed in your **Active users** list. 
  
## How do external users show up in my Active users list?

External users who authenticate to access shared documents and sites appear in the **Active Users** list with #EXT# tags next to their email addresses. For example, if you give an external user "Brooke Miranda" with the Microsoft account email "brooke@outlook.com" access to your team site at contoso.com, Brooke appears in your **Active users** list with the **Display name** Brooke Miranda, and her email address appears like this: 
  
 **brooke_outlook.com#EXT#@contoso.com**
  
## Will external users show up in my Active users list if they don't have to authenticate?

No, if you share a document or site with an anonymous access link, people who access the document or site won't appear in the **Active users** list. 
  
## Who can control the sharing settings for SharePoint Online?

You have to be a SharePoint admin to change external sharing settings for individual site collections. If you're a Global admin in Office 365, you're also automatically a SharePoint admin for all the sites.
  
## How do I share SharePoint sites and files?

On any SharePoint Online site, choose the **Share** icon in the top-right corner and enter the email address of the person you want to share with. 
  
To share files, in any document library, choose the ellipses next to a file name \> **Share**, and enter the email addresses of the people you want to share with.
