# Why can't I upgrade plans?

If you don't see any plans on the **Upgrade** tab, it means your plan can't be upgraded automatically. In some cases, you might be able to resolve the issue so that you can view plans available for upgrade, or you might be able to upgrade or change plans manually, instead.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to the admin center (preview). The preview is available to all Microsoft 365 admins, you can opt in by selecting **Try the preview** toggle located at the top of the Home page. For more information, see [About Microsoft 365 admin center preview](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md). To view the article about the old admin center, see [Why can't I switch Office 365 for business plans?](why-can-t-i-switch-plans.md).

## Why are there no plans listed to upgrade?

### You can't upgrade subscriptions now because you have more users than licenses.

To upgrade plans automatically, all of your users need to be assigned valid licenses. If you have assigned more licenses than you have
purchased, you'll see an alert on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264" target="_blank">Licenses</a> page that says you have a licensing conflict that needs to be resolved. [Learn how to resolve license conflicts](../subscriptions-and-billing/resolve-license-conflicts.md). After you have resolved any licensing conflicts, you should see plans listed on the **Upgrade** tab. If not, you can [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md), or [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).

### You can't upgrade subscriptions right now because this subscription isn't fully set up or the service isn\'t available.

For example, if one of the services has an incident, you won't be able to upgrade until all services are healthy. To see if there are
provisioning or service health issues, in the admin center, go to the **Health** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842900" target="_blank">Service health</a> page.

If you find that a service is not fully provisioned, or you have a service health issue, please wait a few hours for your service to become available, and try again. If you still have a problem, please [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).

### You can't upgrade plans because another plan is in the process of being upgraded or is pending a credit check.

Wait until the credit check has been completed before upgrading plans. Credit checks can take up to two working days.

### Currently, this subscription is not eligible to upgrade.

You can [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).

### I see a different message than what's listed here.

You can [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).

## Additional reasons you can't Upgrade

### You have two or more plans for the same product

You can only use the **Upgrade** tab if all users subscribe to the same plan. For example, if you have two Office 365 Business Premium plans, you won't be able to automatically upgrade one of them to another plan.

### You have a prepaid plan

If you've paid for your subscription in advance, you might be able to [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md). However, you won't receive a credit for unused time remaining on your current subscription if you upgrade plans before the current plan expires.

You can also [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.

### You have a government or non-profit plan

If you have a government or non-profit plan, you can [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md) or [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.

### The subscription that you want to upgrade from has a temporary issue

You might not see any plans on the **Upgrade** tab because the service is in the process of upgrading a high volume of plans. Try again in
about an hour after your first attempt.

### The plan that you want to upgrade to isn't a supported option

When you upgrade plans, the plans that are available for you to upgrade to are displayed based on the services in your current plan. You can only upgrade to a plan that has the same data-related services, such as Exchange Online or SharePoint Online, or to a higher version of them. This ensures that users don\'t lose data related to those services during the upgrade.

If your plan isn't eligible to upgrade plans automatically, you might be able to [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md),
instead. You can also [call support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help.

### Your subscription has an Add-on

If you have an Add-on with your subscription, you might be able to [change plans manually](change-plans-manually.md).

### Your subscription has an unpaid balance

To resolve this, find the subscription on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Products & services</a> page, and choose the **Pay now** link in the **Billing** section. After the payment has been made, check the **Upgrade** tab again.
