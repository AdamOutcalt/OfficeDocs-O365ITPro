# Office 365 Assistant for admins

We're bringing something new to your experience! Administrators will now have 24x7 access to our chatbot, to help you quickly find relevant solutions and information. Here's a few things we think you should know.
  
## Things to try

We're continually adding new dialogs to the chat library to address your scenarios, but here's a sample of some of the things you can try now:
  
- How do I move mail?
    
- I need help setting up Skype for Business
    
- What is Microsoft Teams?
    
- What's the difference between minimal and express hybrid migration?
    
- What are the different versions of Azure Active Directory?
    
- How do I onboard to Office ProPlus?
    
- How do I onboard to Exchange 2016?
    
- What is Exchange Online Protection?
    
## Finding your way around

To find the Office 365 Assistant, click the ![A screen capture of the icon to launch help](../media/31e853ee-2270-4b4d-b9d7-831773e1a989.png) button in the bottom corner of the admin center. You'll also find it on the Office home page and we'll add more locations over time. If you don't see chat now, be patient - the experience is rolling out gradually to our customers. And, you can always switch to classic view if that's your preference.
