# Do an admin takeover in Office 365

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.md)** if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
## Step 1: Verify your email address

1. Enter your email address in the prompt so we can send you a link to join the Office 365 account where your domain is currently added.
    
2. Once you receive your email, [Sign out of Office 365](https://login.microsoftonline.com/logout.srf) from your current account. 
    
3. Follow the email link that shows your email address and a **Yes, that's me** button. 
    
## Step 2: Create a new account

1. When you follow the **Yes, that's me** link in your email, you'll be brought to a page where you create a new account. 
    
2. Fill in the user name and password field with what you want to use once you're done and click **Start**. 
    
## Step 3: Verify domain ownership and become the admin

1. A wizard will open called **"Become the admin"**. If the wizard doesn't start for you look for the **Admin tile** and click on it. 
    
2. Click **"Yes, I want to be the admin"**
    
3. You'll need to verify that you own the domain you want to take over by adding a TXT record to your domain registrar.
    
1. The wizard will show you the TXT record to add as well as provide a link to your registrars website and a link to step-by-step instructions.
    
2. Once you've added the TXT record at your registrars site, come back to the wizard and click **Okay, I've added the record.**
    
> [!NOTE]
> If someone in the account signed up to use Office Online at work (instead of one of the other subscriptions, like Power BI), you'll be prompted to and required to buy licenses for them as part of becoming the admin for the domain. But you can add or remove licenses after you finish admin setup.
