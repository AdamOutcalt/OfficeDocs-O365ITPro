# Add customized help desk info to the Office 365 help pane

As an admin, you can streamline user support by adding customized contact information to the help pane. Users in need of help will be able to access your organization's custom support contact info with the help icon.
  
To create a custom help desk card, you must be a global admin for Office 365 and have a license to Exchange Online. Learn how to [assign licenses in Office 365 for business](../manage/assign-licenses-to-users.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an admin looking for technical or billing support from Microsoft, see [Contact Office 365 for business support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md). 

  
### Create the custom help desk card in the admin center
<a name="BKMK_HelpDeskPreview"> </a>

1. In the admin center, go to the **Settings** > **Settings** and choose **Help desk information** tab.
    
2. On the **Organization profile** tab, choose **Custom app launcher tiles**.
  
3. Turn on the **Add your help desk contact information**.
    
4. As an admin, you decide what kind of contact information you want to give users. The title and at least one form of contact information are required. Select what you want to display, and fill out the appropriate info.
    
  - **Title**: Enter a title that clearly indicates your intent, like "Contoso help desk" or "Need help?"
    
  - **Phone**: Enter the phone number users should call to talk to a tech support agent at your organization. Be sure to include any prefixes that may be needed to complete the call.
    
  - **Email**: Enter the email address for your support department.
    
  - **URL**: If your support department has an internal or public website with helpful tools and resources, enter its name and the associated URL.
    
5. Select **Save changes**.
    
    To see your new customized help desk card, sign out and back in again. We recommend you test the links on the card as soon as you sign back in. Your users will be able to see the card the next time they sign in.
