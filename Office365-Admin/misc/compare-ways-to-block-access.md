# Compare ways to block access to Office 365

When an employee leaves your organization, on good terms or bad, you need to block their access to Office 365. Here are a few ways you can do that.
  
||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Way to block access** <br/> |**Definition** <br/> |**Best practice** <br/> |
|Block sign-in  <br/> |One way to block a user from accessing Office 365 is to change their sign-in status to **Sign-in blocked**. This prevents them from signing into Office 365 from their computers and mobile devices though they can still view previously downloaded or synced email and documents. If you're using Blackberry Enterprise Service, you can disable their access there as well.  <br/> |Use when an employee plans to leave the organization or they plan to take a long-term leave of absence.  <br/> |
|Reset user password  <br/> |Another way to prevent a user from accessing Office 365 is to reset their password. This prevents them from using their account though they can still view previously downloaded or synced email and documents. You can then sign in as them and change the password to one of your choosing.  <br/> |Use when an employee leaves suddenly and permanently and you feel there is concern for business data.  <br/> |
|Remove all assigned licenses  <br/> |Another option is to remove any Office 365 licenses assigned to the user. This prevents them from using applications and services like the Office suite, Office Online, Yammer, and SharePoint Online. They can still sign in but cannot use these services.  <br/> |Use when you feel this user no longer needs access to specific features in Office 365.  <br/> > [!IMPORTANT]> When you remove a license, the user's mailbox will be deleted in 30 days.           |
