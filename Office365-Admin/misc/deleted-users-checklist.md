# Quick help: Deleted users checklist

So, you've decided to delete a user from your organization. For example, you can delete a user once that person leaves your organization. There are a few things you should do before and after you delete that user. This quick checklist helps you with the steps.
  
## Remove the Office 365 license from the user

You can remove a license from a user by searching for the user on the home page, or from the **Active users** page, and then selecting them. In the **Product licenses** row, choose **Edit**. Switch the toggle to the **Off** position for the license you want to remove from the user. [Read full article](../subscriptions-and-billing/remove-licenses-from-users.md).
  
## Block sign in

You can block the user so they can't sign in to your Office 365 organization. You can search for the user on the home page, or from the **Active users** page, and then select them. From the user page, on the **Sign-in status** row, choose **Edit** and select **Sign-in blocked**. [Read full article](../add-users/assign-admin-roles.md).

## What to do with the unassigned license

If you have a new employee or person that's joining your organization, you can assign them this license so they can use Office 365. You can search for the user on the home page, or from the **Active users** page, and then select them. In the **Product licenses** row, choose **Edit**. Switch the toggle to the **On** position for the license you want to add to the new user. [Read full article](../subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users.md).
  
## Remove license so you don't have to pay for it

You can also remove license from your subscription so you don't have to pay for it. From the admin center home page, type **subscription** and click or tap **View subscriptions**. Choose **Add/remove licenses**. In the **Total licenses** box, enter the total number of licenses that you need for this subscription and then select **Submit**. For example, if you had 5 licenses and you need to remove 1 of them, you would enter **4**. [Read full article](../subscriptions-and-billing/remove-licenses-from-subscription.md).
