# New Office 365 web experiences - working with your apps and online documents

We have introduced a number of changes to Office 365 in the web to simplify and personalize the user experiences for you and your users.
  
The app launcher is personalized and helps users open and switch between the apps they use most. The apps that users see are still based on the licenses their admin has assigned. However, the main view emphasizes the most used applications across Office 365. It also highlights additional apps relevant to your users. For example, teachers and students may see education-specific apps.
  
Later in this article you will find two videos. [Admin overview video: Meet the Office 365 app launcher](new-web-experiencesapp-launcher.md#bkmk_Video) will show you the new experience so you can prepare for the change and [Snapshot video: Introducing new Office 365 web experiences](new-web-experiencesapp-launcher.md#bkmk_snapshot) is a brief video you can share with your users. 
  
The videos introduce the Office 365 app launcher as well as highlight how [www.office.com](https://www.office.com) is an easy to remember URL to help users get started with all things Office 365 and specifically, working with online documents. Additionally, the Office 365 gallery page available from [www.office.com](https://www.office.com), helps you and your users better understand the apps, tools, and services that are part of your Office 365 subscriptions.

## Frequently asked questions
<a name="bkmk_snapshot"> </a>

Here's a list of some frequently asked questions. Don't see your question answered here? Leave us your question at the bottom of this page: **Was this information helpful?**
  
### Can I pin admin custom tiles to the main view of the launcher for my organization?
<a name="bkmk_pinQ"> </a>

- Admins will continue to have the ability to add custom tiles to share line-of-business (LOB) apps, sites, and URLs with their organization. However, they will only show in the main view if pinned by an end-user.
    
- The **All view** is optimized for search and there's a new grouping at the top of this view called **Admin selected apps** for admin custom tiles so that users can easily discover them. 
    
### Will all my users see the same apps they do today?
<a name="bkmk_pinQ"> </a>

A user's main view includes their new defaults and any additional apps a user has utilized in the  *last 45 days ï»¿ *before they saw the new app launcher* *  . From the All view, users can also easily pin any app, including admin custom tiles, to the main view of their launcher. 
  
### What happened to the Mail, Calendar, People and Tasks tiles?
<a name="mcpttiles"> </a>

Access to all Outlook modules is consolidated in the main view of the app launcher with a single tile called **Outlook** that opens Mail. People, Calendar, and Tasks can be accessed through the menu in the lower-left corner of the Outlook app (beneath the folders), just like on the desktop. Direct access is also available with individual Calendar, People and Tasks tiles in the **ALL** apps view, and the tiles can be pinned to the main view of the app launcher, like other apps. Additionally, if a user clicked on Calendar, People, or Tasks directly in the previous 45 days\*, we will automatically show it in the Apps section of www.office.com. 
  
### Will my users' apps highlighted in the main view keep changing based on their use?
<a name="mcpttiles"> </a>

After your users see the new launcher for the first time, apps in the main view will stay the same, unless a user chooses to customize their apps or an administrator adds or removes licenses. If you have difficulty finding an app, click **All your apps** and search or look through the alphabetized list of apps available. The apps section on www.office.com, however, will reflect apps recently used outside of a user's default apps. 
  
### Is the Pin to Top feature to pin apps to the Office 365 navbar still available?
<a name="mcpttiles"> </a>

No. With the new app launcher's more personalized default experience as well as the low usage of the pin to top feature in the current experience, we removed the capability. To help ensure that you have access to your most relevant apps, any application that is used recently from the top will be pinned to the main view of your new launcher. Another option for one-click access to get started with your favorite applications is to sign-in at www.office.com. The app section at the top of the page includes all of your most used applications.
  
### Are there additional resources to help me train my users?
<a name="mcpttiles"> </a>

Yes. We've created a ~5 minutes [Microsoft Mechanics video](https://youtu.be/9mEYBpUsb6k) to explain the new Office 365 app launcher experience, as well as the new Office 365 gallery and changes to [www.office.com](https://www.office.com). Additionally, you can listen to our archived [Microsoft Ignite session](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IMV97BwS5Xk) where we go into more depth on the new experiences and the customer challenges they are designed to help. 
  
### How can I get an early look at new experiences coming to Office 365?
