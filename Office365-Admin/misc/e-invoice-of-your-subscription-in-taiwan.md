# Understand your e-Invoice for Office 365 for business (Taiwan)

e-Invoice is electronic invoice issued by seller after buyer purchases in accordance with Taiwan Tax Authority's e-Invoice requirements. Information is transmitted to Taiwan Tax Authority's Electronic Invoice Cloud for record keeping. For Taiwan e-Invoice related information, please refer here: [財政部電子發票整合服務平台](https://www.einvoice.nat.gov.tw/)
  
A sample copy of e-Invoice is included here:

## What is my tax rate?

For commercial purchases, we apply taxes in addition to the quoted price of our subscriptions at a rate prescribed by Taiwan Tax Authority. For any tax related questions or planning, please work with your tax advisor.
  
## When will e-Invoice start for my Office 365 services?

Microsoft will replace current computerized invoice with e-Invoice on **September 15th**. For billing prior to September 15th, paper copy tax invoices are mailed directly to customers. After September 15th, e-Invoice will be offered in your Office 365 admin center for view, download, and print, and will no longer be mailed directly to you. 
  
## Where can I find my e-Invoice?

You can view, download, and print your e-Invoice the day after your bill is ready, through your Office 365 admin center, together with your monthly bill. [View your bill](https://support.office.com/zh-TW/article/2ae3ea58-4fce-4592-91d6-46e9ae3ec218).
