# Understand your e-Invoice for Office 365 for business (Taiwan)

e-Invoice is electronic invoice issued by seller after buyer purchases in accordance with Taiwan Tax Authority's e-Invoice requirements. Information is transmitted to Taiwan Tax Authority's Electronic Invoice Cloud for record keeping. For Taiwan e-Invoice related information, please refer here: <a href="https://www.einvoice.nat.gov.tw/" target="_blank">財政部電子發票整合服務平台</a>

## What is my tax rate?

For commercial purchases, we apply taxes in addition to the quoted price of our subscriptions at a rate prescribed by Taiwan Tax Authority. For any tax related questions or planning, please work with your tax advisor.
  
## When will e-Invoice start for my Office 365 services?

Microsoft will replace current computerized invoice with e-Invoice on **September 15th**. For billing prior to September 15th, paper copy tax invoices are mailed directly to customers. After September 15th, e-Invoice will be offered in your Microsoft 365 admin center for view, download, and print, and will no longer be mailed directly to you. 
  
## Where can I find my e-Invoice?

You can view, download, and print your e-Invoice the day after your bill is ready, through your admin center, together with your monthly bill. [View your bill](../subscriptions-and-billing/view-your-bill-or-invoice.md).
