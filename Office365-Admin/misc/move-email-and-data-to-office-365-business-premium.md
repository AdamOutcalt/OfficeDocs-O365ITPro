# Move email and data to Office 365 Business Premium

When you upgrade to Office 365 Business Premium, we give you a brand new  *business identity*. You get a new email account, and a separate OneDrive account for your business data. 
  
If you want to move some of your personal data over to your new business identity, follow the instructions below.
  
## [OneDrive](#tab/OneDrive)
  
 **Copy your OneDrive data**
1. Create a temporary folder on your hard drive to temporarily store the files that you want to migrate to Office 365 for business.
    
2. Go to [https://onedrive.live.com/](https://onedrive.live.com/) and sign in using the Microsoft account that you use to access your Office 365 for home subscription. 
    
3. Copy the files that you want to use with Office 365 for business to the local folder that you created in step 1.
    
 **Import OneDrive files to Office 365 for business**
1. Go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=816877) and sign in with your Office 365 Business user name and password. 
    
2. Select the **app launcher** icon in the upper-left and then choose **OneDrive**.
  
    > [!TIP]
    > The first time you open OneDrive for Business, you'll need to set up your OneDrive. If this occurs, on the **Welcome to OneDrive for Business** page, select **Next**. After OneDrive is set up, select **Your OneDrive is ready**. 
  
3. You'll be taken to an empty OneDrive folder. If you want to create sub folders, select **New** \> **Folder**.

4. Select **Upload** to copy the files from your hard drive where you copied your OneDrive files. 
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can upload individual files and groups of files (such as all files in a particular folder) at one time but you cannot copy a folder to OneDrive for Business. Instead, you'll need to create the folder structure you want on OneDrive for business. >  If you want to copy files to a folder that you created in step 4, open that folder before you upload the files. Otherwise, the files will be uploaded to the root folder. You can also move your files between folders in OneDrive for Business after you've uploaded them. 
  
## [Outlook/Email](#tab/Outlook)
  
 **Export Outlook 2013 information to an Outlook data file**
1. Before you can create your Outlook data file (.pst), the account that you want to export Outlook information from must already be added to the desktop version of Outlook. For information about how to add an account to Outlook 2013 or higher, see [Set up email in Outlook (for Windows)](https://support.office.com/article/6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b.aspx) or [Set up email in Outlook for Mac 2011](https://support.office.com/article/d7b404a0-6e18-4d95-bed8-2de7661563ca.aspx).
    
2. Each user needs to complete the steps in [Export or backup email, contacts, and calendar to an Outlook .pst file](https://support.office.com/article/14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91.aspx).
    
 **Set up your new email account in Outlook**
1. Each user needs to set up their new email account that came with the Office 365 for business subscription. To do this, they'll need the address of their new email account. Each user's email account is the same as the user name that they use to sign into Office 365 for business. It will look something like sue@contoso.onmicrosoft.com or david@contoso.com.
    
2. Ask each user to add their email account to Outlook. To learn how, see [Set up email in Outlook (for Windows)](https://support.office.com/article/6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b.aspx) or [Set up email in Outlook for Mac 2011](https://support.office.com/article/d7b404a0-6e18-4d95-bed8-2de7661563ca.aspx).
    
 **Import information from the Outlook data file**
1. This merges the email, calendar, tasks, and contacts that are stored in the PST file into your Office 365 for business email account.
    
2. To import the information stored in the PST file into your Office 365 for business email account, have each user complete the steps in [Import email, contacts, and calendar from an Outlook .pst file](https://support.office.com/article/431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac.aspx).
