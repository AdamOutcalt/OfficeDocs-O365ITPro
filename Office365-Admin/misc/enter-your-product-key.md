# Enter your product key for Office 365 Business Premium purchased from a Microsoft store

If you purchased Office 365 Business Premium from a retail store, this article helps you activate your subscription. 
  
 **Need something else?**
 **For help with Office 365 Home, or Personal**, see [Using product keys with Office](https://support.office.com/article/12a5763a-d45c-4685-8c95-a44500213759.aspx).  
 **Volume licensing customer?** If you bought Office 365 for business through a [Microsoft Open program](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=613298), see the article, [Enter your product key purchased from Microsoft Open](purchases-from-microsoft-open.md).
  
## Activate a new subscription

1. Go to [office.com/setupkey](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=839911).
    
2. Enter your product key, then choose **Next**.
    
3. Enter your name, work email address, business phone number, company name, and country or region, then choose **Next**.
    
4. Enter a phone number to receive either a text or call to verify your identity.
    
5. You can get a new domain, use a domain name you already own, or add a domain later. The steps can vary, so follow the prompts, depending on which option you choose.
    
6. When you're finished, go to the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837890) to manage your subscription. 
    
## Renew or add a user license to an existing subscription

To renew or add a user license to your existing Office 365 Business Premium subscription with a product key, you need a new and unused key for the same Office 365 plan. Entering your original Office 365 product key won't work because a key that has already been redeemed can't be used again.
  
1. Go to [office.com/setupkey](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=839911).
    
2. Enter your product key, then choose **Next**.
    
3. In the **Tell us about yourself** section, enter your existing Office 365 email, then choose **Sign in**. Follow the prompts to finish signing in.
    
4. If you have additional keys to add, choose **Add another product key**. When you're ready, choose **Next**.
    
5. You can choose to either **Add a user** or **Renew your subscription**. If you added more than one key, the number of users or subscription end date will change, depending on how many keys you added. When you're ready, choose **Next**.
    
6. Verify the option you chose, then choose **redeem**.
