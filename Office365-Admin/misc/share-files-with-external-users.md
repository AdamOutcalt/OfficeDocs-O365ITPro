# Quick help: Share files with external users

If your organization shares documents or sites with vendors, clients, or customers, you can use the external sharing features of SharePoint Online.
  
## Share a SharePoint site with external users

To Share a site:
  
On any SharePoint Online site, choose the **Share** icon in the top-right corner and enter the email address of the person you want to share with.

## Share files with external users

To share files:
  
1. Choose the ellipses next to a file name \> **Share**.

## Can I turn off external sharing?

Yes. Do the following:
  
1. From the SharePoint admin center, choose **site collections**. 
    
2. Check the box next to those site collections whose sharing settings you want to turn on or off, and in the ribbon, choose **Sharing**. 
    
3. Select **Don't allow sharing outside your organization**.
    
For detailed instructions, see [turn external sharing on or off](https://support.office.com/article/c8a462eb-0723-4b0b-8d0a-70feafe4be85.aspx).
  
## Who can manage external sharing?

You have to be a SharePoint admin to change external sharing settings for individual site collections. If you're a Global admin in Office 365, you're also automatically a SharePoint admin for all the sites.
  
## What if my question still hasn't been answered?
