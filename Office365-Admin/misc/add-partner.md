An authorized partner of Microsoft who serves as your subscription advisor provides the sales, support, and technical expertise you need to help you set up and maintain your subscription. You can add a subscription advisor partner as a partner of record when you purchase Office 365 or at another time. If you're not currently working with a partner, you can also find one on the [Microsoft Pinpoint](https://pinpoint.microsoft.com) website.

The partner you choose depends on the Office 365 services you use and the country or region where you'll use those services. If you are adding a partner, or changing the partner for your subscription, first you need to get the partner's Microsoft Partner ID by asking the partner for it.

As an admin for Office 365, you can create or edit users, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, manage domains, and assign admin permissions to other users in your organization, among other things. However, if you want someone else to do these administrative tasks, you can delegate this role to an authorized partner of 21Vianet by creating a partner relationship.
