Here is the body text.
  
1. In the Admin center, go to the [Domains](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818) page, or choose **Setup** \> **Domains**.
 
2. Choose **Add domain**.
    
3. Enter the name of the domain you want to add, then choose **Next**.
    
4. Choose how you want to verify that you own the domain.
  
    1. If your domain is registered at GoDaddy or 1&amp;1, choose **Sign in** and Office 365 [will set up your records automatically](../get-help-with-domains/domain-connect.md).
    
    2. You can have an email sent to the registered contact for the domain with a verification code. If you don't recognize or have access to the email on record, you can use option 3.
    
    3. You can use a TXT record to verify your domain. Select this and choose **Next** to see instructions for how to add this DNS record to your registrar's website. This can take up to 30 minutes to verify after you've added the record.
