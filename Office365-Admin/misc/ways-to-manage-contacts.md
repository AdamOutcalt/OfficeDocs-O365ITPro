# Quick help: Ways to manage contacts

There are a number of ways you can work with contacts in Office 365 and much of it depends on how you use contacts. Here's a comparison of the different ways to help you choose the right one for your organization.
  
|||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Feature** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |**Advantages** <br/> |**Disadvantages** <br/> |
|**Office 365 contacts** <br/> |Use Office 365 contacts to store your customers or business contacts and they will appear under People in Office 365. See [Contacts](contacts.md) <br/> |Everyone in the organization can view the contacts directly from Outlook, Outlook on the web, and mobile devices.  <br/> |Only administrators can create and update the contacts.  <br/> No custom fields are allowed (example: birthdate, college, referral agent).  <br/> |
|**SharePoint contacts** <br/> |Use a SharePoint Contacts app to store your customers or business contacts and they will appear on your SharePoint site and SharePoint mobile apps. See [SharePoint apps and lists](https://support.office.com/article/0a1c3ace-def0-44af-b225-cfa8d92c52d7.aspx).  <br/> |Everyone with access to the SharePoint team site and SharePoint mobile apps can see and update these contacts.  <br/> Allows for custom fields, views, workflows and more.  <br/> |These contacts don't appear in Outlook or People in Office 365.  <br/> Requires basic understanding of SharePoint infrastructure.  <br/> |
|**Access contacts** <br/> |Use an Access Contacts app to store your customers or business contacts and they will appear in Access or a SharePoint site if hosted there. See [Access apps](https://support.office.com/article/25f3ab3e-510d-44b0-accf-b976c0813e71.aspx).  <br/> |Everyone with access to Access or the SharePoint site that hosts the app can see and update contacts.  <br/> Highly customizable and professional looking contact management built with Access.  <br/> |You must purchase Microsoft Access or switch to an Office 365 plan that includes Access.  <br/> Requires basic understanding of Microsoft Access and how to create apps.  <br/> |
|**Dynamics CRM Online** <br/> |Use Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online to store and manage your customers and potential business opportunities. See [Dynamics CRM](https://dynamics.microsoft.com).  <br/> |Powerful customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities.  <br/> Integrates with Office 365 so you can work from one place.  <br/> |Includes complexity with onboarding and customization to meet your needs.  <br/> Is significantly higher in cost than any of the other contact management options.  <br/> |
|**Third party app** <br/> |If none of the above options interest you, you might consider a third party app in the [Office Store](https://store.office.com) or external to Microsoft.  <br/> |Many providers, features, and prices to choose for your business customers.  <br/> |No guarantee that it's integrated with Office 365, requiring you to work with two different services, logins, etc.  <br/> |
