1. Click the Yammer settings icon ![Yammer settings icon](/Office365/Admin/media/9704ce70-56ce-43f7-96c6-f253b0413d40.png), and then click **Edit Settings**.

## FAQ

 **Q. What happens to users who have no activity after 12 months?**
  
A. Users that have been inactive for 12 months are suspended for 14 days and notified by email. To keep their Yammer account, they need to log on to Yammer. If they have not logged on to Yammer by the end of the 14 days, the user's account is deleted from Yammer.
