### You're a student or teacher and don't see an option to install Office
<a name="BKMK_StudentTeacher"> </a>

If you're a student or teacher and don't see an option to install Office, you may be eligible for Office 365 Education, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. All you need to get started is a valid school email address. For more information, see [Get Office 365 for free](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education).
  
Before you install Office, be sure to check the [System requirements for Office](https://products.office.com/en-US/office-system-requirements). For example, you can't install Office on a Chromebook or a computer running Windows Vista or Windows XP. However, you may still be able to use [Office Online](https://support.office.com/article/5622c7c9-721d-4b3d-8cb9-a7276c2470e5.aspx) in your computer's browser. 
  
### You don't see an option to install Office, check if you have a license
<a name="BKMK_CheckLicense"> </a>

1. If you're not already signed in, go to [http://portal.office.com](http://portal.office.com) and sign in with your work or school account. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're unable to sign in with your work or school account, you may be signing in to the wrong Office 365 service, see [Where to sign in to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4). 
  
2. From the browser header, go to **Settings**![Settings: update your profile, install software and connect it to the cloud](media/4b83e9cb-c7e4-46c8-b3d1-cfee017123ae.png) \> **My app settings** \> **Office 365**.
    
    ![Office 365 Settings pane](media/13ea9957-8ba6-49d3-bf65-cd2e717317a1.png)
  
3. On the My account page, select **Subscriptions**.
    
    ![Office 365 Subscriptions page](media/a132e20f-de6c-461d-beb2-2d8cf1a04f1d.png)
  
    You'll see the services that you're licensed to use, such as the latest desktop version of Office, SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business, and Exchange Online. If you don't see **The latest desktop version of Office** in the list (or **Project** or **Visio** if your organization has a plan that includes those applications) your admin probably hasn't assigned an Office license to you. If you're an admin, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](assign-licenses-to-users.md). For more information, see [What Office 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.office.com/article/f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd.aspx)
    
    If you have a license, then you're ready to [Install Office on your PC or Mac](https://support.office.com/article/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658.aspx), (or [install Project](https://support.office.com/article/7059249b-d9fe-4d61-ab96-5c5bf435f281.aspx#BKMK_ProjectO365) or [Visio](https://support.office.com/article/f98f21e3-aa02-4827-9167-ddab5b025710.aspx#BKMK_VisioOffice365)).
    
Not all Office 365 plans come with Office. If your organization has an Office 365 plan that doesn't include the latest desktop version of Office, the Office 365 admin can [switch to a different Office 365 plan or subscription](switch-to-a-different-plan-0.md).
  
If you're an admin and you aren't sure what plan you have, follow the steps in [What Office 365 for business subscription do I have?](what-subscription-do-i-have-0.md) For a comparison of plans, see [compare small business plans](https://products.office.com/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) or [compare enterprise plans](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).
  
### Computers running Windows Vista or Windows XP don't meet system requirements to install Office
<a name="BKMK_ChromebookError"> </a>

You can't install Office 2016 or Office 2013 on computers running Windows Vista or Windows XP as these operating systems don't meet the [system requirements for Office](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements). Attempting to install Office on a computer running an unsupported operating system will result in an error. (If you're interested in learning more about the latest version of Windows, see [Windows 10 specifications](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications) for details.) 
  
If your computer can't install the full desktop version of Office because your computer doesn't meet the system requirements, you can try using [Office Online](https://products.office.com/office-online/documents-spreadsheets-presentations-office-online) in your computer's browser. See the [supported browser](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements#Browsers-section) section on the system requirements page. 
  
### Office install hangs or is stuck at 90%
<a name="BKMK_OfficeHangs"> </a>

If Office is taking a long time to install you may be on a slow connection or you another install or update may be happening in the background. See [Office is taking long to install](https://support.office.com/article/0f09f357-3fef-42a6-b8aa-cef4c6c44bdf.aspx) or [Office hangs at 90%](https://support.office.com/article/35e6952b-eff9-4bd3-9c9b-bb3c2aba7f16.aspx) for possible solutions. 
  
### You don't want all the Office applications or you want to install Office on a different drive
<a name="BKMK_CustomInstall"> </a>

With Office 365 you can't custom select which Office applications you want to install. However, you can delete shortcuts to applications you don't plan to use.
  
Additionally, you can only install Office on the system drive where your operating system is installed. That's usually your C: drive.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you decide you want to purchase a stand-alone Office application, you can go to [https://products.office.com/](https://products.office.com/) and do a search for the application you want to buy. 
  
### You're having trouble signing in
<a name="BKMK_SignIn"> </a>

Microsoft has more than one kind of Office 365 service and each service has its own sign-in page. Where you sign in depends on which service you're using.
  
If you use one of the services listed under the [Office for business plans](https://support.office.com/article/28cbc8cf-1332-4f04-9123-9b660abb629e.aspx), you sign in at [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com) with the username and password that you created or someone in your organization created on your behalf. 
  
If you use **Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China**, sign in at [https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn](https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn) with the username and password that you created or someone in your organization in China created on your behalf. 
  
For more information about accounts, see [Where to sign in to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4) or [What is my user ID and why do I need it for Office 365 for business?](https://support.office.com/article/37da662b-5da6-4b56-a091-2731b2ecc8b4.aspx)
  
If you can't remember your password and need to reset it, go to [passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/).

## Error messages or install greyed out
<a name="BKMK_Errors"> </a>

### Install button doesn't install Office
<a name="BKMK_InstallGreyed"> </a>

If the Install button is grayed out, your Office 365 subscription might have expired. Select your subscription from the list below to see the steps for how to renew it. See, [Renew Office 365 for business](renew-your-subscription-0.md)
  
For other solutions, see [Install button doesn't install Office](https://support.office.com/article/1c23ab29-5e15-4421-854e-e76d9dc0df7f.aspx).
  
### You get a KERNEL32.dll error when trying to install Office and other system requirement issues
<a name="BKMK_Kernell32Error"> </a>

Check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements to install Office. You need a computer running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10. See [System requirements for Office](https://products.office.com/en-US/office-system-requirements) for a list of additional requirements. 
  
If you're trying to install Office on a computer running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you may get an error that says the dynamic library KERNEL 32.dll can't be located. This occurs because the Office Office 365 desktop apps aren't supported on these versions of Windows. For more information, see [Why can't I install Office on Windows XP or Windows Vista?](https://support.office.com/article/eb587689-fc9b-4df1-8eab-0b7e92be52e8.aspx)
  
If you're not sure which operating system you have, see [Which Windows operating system am I running?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system) or [Find the OS X version and build number on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/HT201260).

## Activation or unlicensed product issues
<a name="BKMK_Activation"> </a>

If you have an Office 365 plan, to keep it active, you have to sign in at least once every 30 days. If your subscription hasn't expired, Office will reactivate the subscription the next time you log in.
  
### Troubleshoot activation failures
<a name="BKMK_ActivationFail"> </a>

As an Office 365 for business user, you can download [Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365](https://diagnostics.office.com/) to help you fix activation issues. 
  
If that tool doesn't resolve your issue or you recently switched plans and now get an unlicensed product error or can't use your Office applications, see [Unlicensed Product and activation errors in Office](https://support.office.com/article/0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380.aspx).
  
If activation failures began after you upgraded to Windows 10, see [Office error code 0x8004FC12 when activating Office](https://support.office.com/article/f32c97d5-11f7-4e56-925c-94959b222bd3.aspx).
  
### Deactivate an install
<a name="BKMK_DeactivateInstall"> </a>

You can activate Office on up to five computers. If you've used up your five installs and want to install Office on another computer, you have to deactivate an installation. Deactivation doesn't remove Office from the computer, but you can't use Office on that computer until you activate it.
  
If you're an Office 365 user, do the following to deactivate an installation.
  
1. Go to [https://portal.office.com/Account/#home](https://portal.office.com/Account/). If prompted, sign in with your work or school account.
    
2. From the Install status tile, select **Manage installs**.
    
3. Under **Install status**, select **Deactivate** to deactivate the Office installations you no longer use. 
    
For more information, see [Deactivate an Office 365 for business install](https://support.office.com/article/80718b40-fc4c-47c8-868f-834dc353c876.aspx).
  
## Upgrade or update issues
<a name="BKMK_Upgrade"> </a>

### Upgrade Office
<a name="BKMK_Upgrade2016"> </a>

If you're on an Office 365 subscription, you're on the latest version of Office and don't need to upgrade to Office 2019.
  
If you're an admin who needs to upgrade your users to the latest Office client, see [Upgrade your users to the latest Office client using Office 365 for business](upgrade-users-to-latest-office-client.md)
  
### Reinstall an older version of Office
<a name="BKMK_Reinstall2013"> </a>

After February 28, 2017 you won't be able to install Office 2013 from [https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware](https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware).

## Troubleshoot issues for Office 365 admins
<a name="BKMK_O365Admin"> </a>

The following issues apply only if you're an Office 365 for business administrator.
  
### I'm an admin and don't have an option to install Office, Project, or Visio
<a name="BKMK_NoOptionInstall"> </a>

When you first sign up for Office 365 for business and you try to install Office (or Project or Visio if you've also signed up for a plan that includes those applications) you might see a message that says you can't install Office because you don't have a license. This could happen because of a delay between your initial sign in and Office 365 for business setting up your environment. Try signing out of Office 365 and then signing back in.
  
It could also happen because you haven't assigned a license to yourself or your users. Do the following to check your licenses.
  
 **Check that you have a license**
  
1. If you're not already signed in, go to [http://portal.office.com](http://portal.office.com) and sign in with your work or school account. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're unable to sign in with your work or school account, you may be signing in to the wrong Office 365 service, see [Where to sign in to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4). 
  
2. From the browser header, go to **Settings**![Settings: update your profile, install software and connect it to the cloud](media/4b83e9cb-c7e4-46c8-b3d1-cfee017123ae.png) \> **My app settings** \> **Office 365**.
    
    ![Office 365 Settings pane](media/13ea9957-8ba6-49d3-bf65-cd2e717317a1.png)
  
3. On the My account page, select **Subscriptions**.
    
    ![Office 365 Subscriptions page](media/a132e20f-de6c-461d-beb2-2d8cf1a04f1d.png)
  
    You'll see the services that you're licensed to use, such as the latest desktop version of Office, Project, Visio, SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business, and Exchange Online. If you don't see **The latest desktop version of Office** in the list (or **Project** or **Visio** if you bought plans with those applications), see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](assign-licenses-to-users.md).
    
    If you have a license, then you're ready to [Install Office on your PC or Mac](https://support.office.com/article/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658.aspx), (or [install Project](https://support.office.com/article/7059249b-d9fe-4d61-ab96-5c5bf435f281.aspx#BKMK_ProjectO365) or [Visio](https://support.office.com/article/f98f21e3-aa02-4827-9167-ddab5b025710.aspx#BKMK_VisioOffice365)).
    
Not all Office 365 plans come with Office. If your organization has an Office 365 plan that doesn't include the latest desktop version of Office, as the admin, you can [switch to a different Office 365 plan or subscription](switch-to-a-different-plan-0.md).
  
If you're not sure what plan you have, follow the steps in [What Office 365 for business subscription do I have?](what-subscription-do-i-have-0.md) For a comparison of plans, see the [small business plans comparison](https://products.office.com/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) or [enterprise plans comparison](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).
  
### I have a volume license for Project or Visio and I get an error when trying to install the click-to-run version of Office
<a name="BKMK_AdminProjectVisioMSI"> </a>

If you have a volume license for Project 2016 and/or Visio 2016 and you're trying in install the click-to-run version of Office 365 ProPlus, you can use the Office Deployment Tool to download and install the click-to-run perpetual (stand-alone) versions of Project 2016 and/or Visio 2016. See [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3157564](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3157564).
  
### How do I install the latest version of Office on more than five computers?
<a name="BKMK_InstallMore"> </a>

You can activate Office on up to five computers. If you want to install on a sixth computer, you have to deactivate an installation. Deactivation doesn't remove Office from the computer, but you can't use Office on that computer until you activate it. See [Deactivate an Office 365 for business install](https://support.office.com/article/80718b40-fc4c-47c8-868f-834dc353c876.aspx).
  
### How do I get the rest of my organization set up with Office 365 for business?
<a name="BKMK_HowSetUp"> </a>

To help you set up your organization, see [Set up Office 365 for business - Admin Help](setup.md).
  
### How do I manage licenses for people in my organization?
<a name="BKMK_ManageLicense"> </a>

Users need licenses to use Outlook, SharePoint Online, Lync Online, and other services. As the Office 365 for business admin, you can assign licenses to new users when creating new accounts, or add licenses to existing users. See [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](assign-licenses-to-users.md).
  
If you need to add more licenses to your subscription, see [Buy licenses for your Office 365 for business subscription](buy-licenses.md).
  
### How do I deploy Office to multiple computers in my organization?
<a name="BKMK_HowDeploy"> </a>

If you're an IT Pro and you want to deploy Office in your organization, use the [Office Deployment Tool](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=402398) to download the Office software to your local network. You then deploy Office by using the software deployment method you typically use. 
  
You can also choose to have users sign into the Office 365 portal with their work or school account and follow the steps in [Install Office on your PC or Mac](https://support.office.com/article/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658.aspx) to install Office themselves. 
  
### You recently switched Office 365 plans and now get messages you can't use Office
<a name="BKMK_SwitchedOfficePlans"> </a>

When you install Office it's automatically linked to your Office 365 plan. This means if you recently switched plans you'll need to uninstall and then reinstall Office to associate it with your updated subscription. Use this easy fix tool and then follow the steps to reinstall Office.
  
1. Click this easy fix button to uninstall Office.
    
    [![Easy fix download button indicating an automated fix is available](media/8b46b28d-8630-458f-b31c-0bbe25e168ec.png)](https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall)
  
2. For the remaining steps showing how to save and use the easy fix, follow the steps for your browser:
    
    **Edge or Internet Explorer**
    
1. At the bottom of the browser window, select **Open** to open the **O15CTRRemove.diagcab** file.
