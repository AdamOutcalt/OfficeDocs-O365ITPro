# What's next for the Microsoft 365 admin center

Welcome to **What's next for the Microsoft 365 admin center**! This article will tell you about new and improved features we're planning and developing so that you can prepare for change. 

Because this article is a new experiment in the type of information that Microsoft is making available, here's the legal disclaimer:

In addition, this information is not a complete list of all features being released. This article might be discontinued or deleted at any time.

## Why are we doing this?
We’ve heard that you would like to know more about what’s coming to the Microsoft 365 admin center, so we are providing you a handy view - specific to your admin experience. You can also use the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap) and the [Message Center](manage/stay-on-top-of-updates.md) to stay informed.

## How to use this article
We're looking forward to hearing from you and we'd like to use this article as a conversation starter between us - the admin and the engineering team. Every item listed in the "In the works" section has a link to our [Office UserVoice](https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin) website, where we want you to vote for items that you're excited about, ask questions, and give us feedback.

## Released
