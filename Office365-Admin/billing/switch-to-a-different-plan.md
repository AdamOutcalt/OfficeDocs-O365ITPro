# Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan
When your business changes, or you need more Office 365 features, you can switch plans.
  
The easiest way to switch plans is to use the **Switch plans** button in the Office 365 admin center. However, using the **Switch plans** button isn't supported in all situations. In some cases, you might be able to switch plans manually.

## Use the Switch plans button in Office 365
<a name="Switchbutton"> </a>

When you use the **Switch plans** button, you're led through the process of buying a new plan that you can switch your current plan to, all users are automatically assigned licenses in the new plan, and your old plan is canceled for you.

If the **Switch plans** button isn't available, you can try to [Switch Office 365 for business plans manually](https://support.office.com/article/eb0d0680-5677-41a0-8c46-4b9d47f1c209) or [](../support/contact-support-for-business-products.md#BKMK_call_support).

Here's why this can happen:
  
- You're using more than one Office 365 plan. You can only use the **Switch plans** button if all users subscribe to the same plan. 
    
- You're already using Office 365 Enterprise E5, so you already have all the functionality available in Office 365.
    
## I don't see the plan I want
<a name="BKMK_PlanNotThere"> </a>

When you use the **Switch plans** button, the plans that you can switch to are displayed based on the services in your current plan. You can only use the **Switch plans** button to switch to a plan that has the same data-related services, or to a higher version. This ensures that users don't lose data related to those services during the switch. 
  
To compare plans before switching, see the [Office 365 for business product comparison](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842056) page. For technical specifications, see [Office 365 Service Descriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842275).
  
If you want to switch to a plan with fewer services, you can [Switch Office 365 for business plans manually](https://support.office.com/article/eb0d0680-5677-41a0-8c46-4b9d47f1c209), or [](../support/contact-support-for-business-products.md#BKMK_call_support) for help.

## Why some switches take longer
<a name="BKMK_SwitchTakesLonger"> </a>

 **Credit checks when switching Office 365 plans**: If you pay by invoice, or reach a certain level of cost, a credit check might be required. A credit check can take up to two business days. Users will have full access to their current plan until you switch them to the new one. 
  
 **Verification of non-profit status**: It normally takes 30 days to complete the verification process for your non-profit status. If it has been more than 30 days, please contact support.
