# Understand your invoice for Office 365 for business

Each month you'll receive an email that tells you that your new billing statement is available in the Office 365 admin center. [View your bill or invoice](https://support.office.com/article/2ae3ea58-4fce-4592-91d6-46e9ae3ec218).
  
Your invoice contains two pages. Page 1 is the invoice summary, and contains general information about the invoice, order, amount due, how to make a payment, and how to contact support.

## Understand billing concepts
<a name="__top"> </a>

Before you view your invoice, it's helpful to understand a few key billing concepts.
  
### Invoice balance vs. order balance

 **Invoice balance** is the amount shown on your invoice, and is only the amount due for that particular billing period. Your total **order balance** is the sum of all unpaid invoices. You can view your order balance in the **Billing** section of the Office 365 admin center. 
  
### Billing frequency vs. invoice frequency

 **Billing frequency** means how often you are billed. Subscriptions are billed either monthly or annually, depending on what option you selected during the subscription purchase. **Invoice frequency** means how often you receive an invoice. If you chose annual billing, you'll only receive one invoice per year, unless activity for your subscription requires a charge or a credit. 
  
If you have more than one order, you'll receive an invoice for each order.
  
## Invoice Field Glossary

The following table describes the fields you might see on your invoice. Some fields listed here might not appear in your invoice, depending on whether you pay by invoice or by credit card or bank account.
