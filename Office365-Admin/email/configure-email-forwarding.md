# Configure email forwarding in Office 365
  
As the admin of an Office 365 organization, you might have company requirements to set up email forwarding for a user's mailbox. Email forwarding lets you forward email messages sent to a user's mailbox to another user's mailbox inside or outside of your organization.
  
## Configure email forwarding

 **Tips:**
  
- **To forward to multiple email addresses**, [create a distribution list](../setup/create-distribution-lists.md), [add the addresses to it](add-user-or-contact-to-distribution-list.md), and then set up forwarding to point to the DL using the instructions in this article.
    
- Once you set up email forwarding, only **new** emails sent to the  *from*  mailbox will be fowarded. 
    
- Email forwarding requires that the  *from*  account has a license. If you're setting up email forwarding because the user has left your organization, another option is to [convert their mailbox to a shared mailbox](convert-user-mailbox-to-shared-mailbox.md). This way several people can access it. However, a shared mailbox cannot exceed 50GB. 
    
You must have [admin permissions](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md) in Office 365 to do this.
