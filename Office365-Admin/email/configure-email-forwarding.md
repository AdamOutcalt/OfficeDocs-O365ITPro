# Configure email forwarding in Office 365
  
As the admin of an Office 365 organization, you might have company requirements to set up email forwarding for a user's mailbox. Email forwarding lets you forward email messages sent to a user's mailbox to another user's mailbox inside or outside of your organization.

## Configure email forwarding

 Before you set up email forwarding, note the following: 

- Once you set up email forwarding, only **new** emails sent to the  *from*  mailbox will be fowarded. 
    
- Email forwarding requires that the  *from*  account has a license. If you're setting up email forwarding because the user has left your organization, another option is to [convert their mailbox to a shared mailbox](convert-user-mailbox-to-shared-mailbox.md). This way several people can access it. However, a shared mailbox cannot exceed 50GB. 
    
You must have [admin permissions](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md) in Office 365 to do these steps.

### Use the new admin center to configure email forwarding

The new admin center is available to all Microsoft 365 admins. You can opt in by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page. For more information, see [About the new Microsoft 365 admin center](../microsoft-365-admin-center-preview.md).

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.
    
2. Select the name of the user whose email you want to forward to open the properties page. 
 
3. On the **Mail** tab, select **Manage email forwarding**. 
  
4. On the email forwarding page, set the toggle to **On**, enter the forwarding address, and choose whether you want to keep a copy of forwarded emails. If you don't see this option, make sure a license is assigned to the user account. Select **Save**.
    
    **To forward to multiple email addresses**, you can ask the user to set up a rule in Outlook to forward to the addresses. To learn more, see [Use rules to automatically forward messages](https://support.office.com/article/use-rules-to-automatically-forward-messages-45aa9664-4911-4f96-9663-ece42816d746). 
    
     Or, in the admin center, [create a distribution group](../setup/create-distribution-lists.md), [add the addresses to it](add-user-or-contact-to-distribution-list.md), and then set up forwarding to point to the DL using the instructions in this article.
    
5. Don't delete the account of the user who's email you're forwarding or remove their license!  If you do, email forwarding will stop.
