# Add a user or contact to an Office 365 distribution list

As the admin of an Office 365 organization, you may need to add one of your users or contacts to a distribution list (see [Create distribution lists in Office 365](../setup/create-distribution-lists.md).) For example, you can add employees or external partners or vendors to an email distribution list.
  
## Add a user or contact to a distribution list

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account. 
    
2. Select the app launcher icon  and choose **Admin**.
    
    Can't find the app you're looking for? From the app launcher, select **All apps** to see an alphabetical list of the Office 365 apps available to you. From there, you can search for a specific app. 
    
3. Choose **Groups**![See your new Office 365 groups in the admin center preview](../media/d434fa62-aff7-4d56-a0c2-2a49b95467a6.png) in the left navigation pane. 
    
4. On the Groups page, select the distribution list you want to add a contact to.
    
5. In the **Members** section, click **Edit**.
