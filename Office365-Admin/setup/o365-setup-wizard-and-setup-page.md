# Difference between the Office 365 setup wizard and the Setup page

Office 365 provides two setup experiences: 

- Initial setup using the setup wizard
- Ongoing and advanced setup using the Setup page

The setup wizard provides a guided walkthrough for setting up the basic Office 365 configuration. After you complete the initial setup, you can go to the Setup page to finish setting up and configuring the services that come with your subscriptions.

## Use the setup wizard to complete initial setup tasks

To set up your account, go to the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), select **Setup** in the left navigation pane, and then select **Guided setup** on the Setup page.

The setup wizard guides you through the following steps:

1. Install the Office 365 apps on your computer.

2. Choose and verify your domain, such as contoso.com.

3. Add new users and assign licenses to them so that they can download and install Office 365 apps.

4. Connect your domain.

## Use the Setup page to complete and manage your configuration 

To access the Setup page in the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), select **Setup** in the navigation pane. Based on products you’ve purchased, features you’ve configured, and your admin role, tasks, and related information from across Office 365 are surfaced here.

You’ll see the complete list of setup tasks arranged in logical categories, including those that you completed in the setup wizard.

Choose **View** for any task to get at-a-glance information, such as task description, user impact, prerequisites, effort to implement, and security and adoption statistics to help you understand consequences and impact before proceeding. The task page shows the status of the task (**Started**, **Not started yet**, or **Completed**). If you're multi-tasking, working on tasks over several days, or if there are multiple admins working on tasks, you can track completion by seeing at a glance which tasks have been completed and which ones still require attention. You’ll also see **Learn more** links for access to comprehensive articles about the settings you’re configuring. The collection of tasks is always here, so you can return to the Setup page at any time to explore resources further.

> [!Note]
> Advanced threat protection requires an add-on service. You can get a free trial of the service by clicking **View** > **Try Office 365 ATP**.

When you're ready to complete a task, select **View** > **Get started** to walk through the configuration process.

You can also manage completed tasks from the Setup page. Click **View** to bring up the task details, and then click **Manage**.
