# Set up Office 365 file storage and sharing

One of the best ways to set up file storage and sharing for your business is to use OneDrive for Business and an Office 365 team site together. This is ideal if you have a small business with a few employees.
  
Office 365 includes a basic team site for you to get started. You can immediately start storing files in OneDrive for Business and collaborating on files in your team site.

## Where you can store documents in Office 365
<a name="BKMK_WhatDif"> </a>

- OneDrive for Business is designed for individual use, with the occasional sharing of files. OneDrive for Business is ideal for storing files you own.
    
- An Office 365 team site is designed for sharing and collaborating on files regularly. A team site is ideal for storing files that have shared ownership where several people or the whole team owns the files and might collaborate on them.
    
Both OneDrive for Business and team sites provide anywhere access for you and your employees.

Here are recommendations for what to store in each location when you use OneDrive for Business and Office 365 team sites together:
  
||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Storage location** <br/> |**What it's for** <br/> |**What to store here** <br/> |
|**OneDrive for Business** <br/> |Storing content on OneDrive for Business is like storing files on your computer; no one else can easily access them.  <br/> For more info, see [What is OneDrive for Business?](https://support.office.com/article/187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2) <br/> |Business files that other team members won't need to collaborate on or access regularly.  <br/> |
|**Office 365 team site** <br/> |When an Office 365 group is created, an Office 365 team site is also created. The team site is like a website, but it's not public; it's accessible only to people you give permissions to.  <br/> For more info, see [Learn about Office 365 groups](https://support.office.com/article/b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2).  <br/> |Shared documents that all of your employees can access and collaborate on. For example, collaborate on a PowerPoint presentation, store team plans that everyone updates, or publish meeting agendas.  <br/> |
|**SharePoint team sites** <br/> |When you create them in SharePoint, an Office 365 group is created.

You can manage them using a SharePoint hub site.  <br/> |
|**SharePoint hub sites** <br/> |While not storage sites themselves, SharePoint hub sites help you meet your needs by connecting and organizing sites based on client, project, department, division, region, etc. For more info on hub sites, see [What is a SharePoint hub site?](https://support.office.com/article/fe26ae84-14b7-45b6-a6d1-948b3966427f) <br/> |Use to share navigation, branding, and search for various sites you use for storage.  <br/> |
   
## Start using OneDrive for Business and your Office 365 group-connected team site for file storage and online collaboration

### Team members can store their own files on OneDrive for Business
<a name="bkmk_step1"> </a>

Each person in your business who has Office 365 access gets OneDrive for Business cloud storage. They can store business-related files here for access from any device, and they are the only available to that user. For example, they might store a draft proposal, their meeting notes, or the script for a demo they're going to deliver.
  
Employees can also share their OneDrive for Business folder with you and coworkers. If an employee is away or leaves the company, others can access shared files stored on OneDrive for Business. 
  
Here's how each person on your team can set up OneDrive for Business and share their folders.
  
![Office 365 home screen with OneDrive select](../media/4e38655d-958c-4517-b622-052c1799b95b.png)
  
1. Go to [office.com](https://portal.office.com) to sign in, and sign in with your user name and password. 
    
2. On the Office 365 home page, choose **OneDrive**.
    
3. In OneDrive for Business, your team members can store their own business-related document. You can share either individual files, or a whole folder. Pick a file or folder, right click, and then choose **Share**.
    
    ![Sharing a folder](../media/e8df9df3-aea5-404d-a320-92d7826c260c.png)
  
4. On the **Send Link** page, leave the default selection **Anyone with the link can view and edit**.﻿
    
    Type names or email addresses of team members who you want to have access to the folder, and add an optional message. 
    
    If you want your own copy of the email that will be sent, add your email address to the list.
    
    ![Share a link dialog box showing showing typing and selecting a name.](../media/877e6587-db9d-4903-a87b-11e570eee926.png)
  
5. When you're done entering who you want to share with, choose **Send**. The email is immediately sent to the people you invite.
    
    ![Share a link, showing list of names](../media/e85625ea-7655-43f3-8623-72db68d0ea39.png)
  
6. Here's what the email looks like when it's sent. It includes an **Open **﻿**** link to your **Shared with Everyone folder** so they can get to it.

### Explore your Office 365 team site
<a name="bkmk_step1"> </a>

Office 365 includes a basic team site with some features to help you get started. Only the people in your business can access this internal website.
  
Here's how you get to your team site:
  
1. Go to [office.com](https://portal.office.com) to sign in, and sign in with your user name and password. 
    
2. On the Office 365 home screen, choose SharePoint and then choose your team site link on the left-hand navigation menu. 
    
3. You'll see your team's home page. This page includes:
    
  - The main page displays team **News** and **Activity**, such as new files added or recently edited. 
    
  - The **+New** button to add elements to the home page, such as a document library, list, or new page. 
    
  - The left-hand navigation menu to get to other areas on your team site, like the team document library.
    
![SharePoint Online Team site home page](../media/fafe9a15-7e5c-470d-99a4-fd56b37064fa.png)
  
### Upload files to your Office 365 team site for online collaboration
<a name="bkmk_step1"> </a>

To help you get started storing and sharing files quickly, your team site comes with a place to store files. It's called the **Documents library** as in a "library of documents." 
  
Here are the steps to add files:
  
1. On the home page of your team site, choose **Documents** from the left-hand navigation menu. This will take you to your **Documents library**. 
    
    ![Team document library](../media/bd4bd33e-dee4-4f33-8eeb-ebf9462c89e2.png)
  
2. While you're still signed in to Office 365, open Windows **File Explorer** from your taskbar or other location. Go to the files you want to upload to your team site. 
    
3. Select the files you want to upload to your team site, and then drag them to the **Document library**.
    
    ![Drag a file from a desktop folder to your library](../media/047e9412-17b0-479a-a6a8-3ea344416946.png)
  
4. When you're done, the files will be stored in both your team site and your computer.
    
    ![Team site library with files](../media/05e4a103-6e66-4484-ab3a-4eac430c20d3.png)
  
5. You can delete the files from your computer. In the next step, [Sync online files with your PC or Mac](set-up-file-storage-and-sharing.md#BKMK_Step4), you're going to create a new location for these files on your computer.
    
    If you have a lot of files or large files to upload to your team site, read these tips on [Upload files to a library](https://support.office.com/article/da549fb1-1fcb-4167-87d0-4693e93cb7a0#__toc384119242).
    
    If you need more storage space, see [Change storage space for your subscription](https://support.office.com/article/96EA3533-DE64-4B01-839A-C560875A662C).
    
### Sync online files with your PC or Mac
<a name="BKMK_Step4"> </a>

Now that you have files on your team site, you can set them up to sync with your PC or Mac. This way, you can work on your files from your PC or Mac instead of working in Microsoft Edge, Chrome, or another browser. It's also useful to have a version of your files synced on your computer for situations when you need to get to a file and you aren't connected to the Internet.
  
After you set up files to sync with your computer, when you're connected to the Internet, they'll be synchronized automatically about every 10 minutes.
  
Here's how to synchronize files on your team site with your desktop:
  
1. On the home page of your team site, choose **Documents** from the left-hand navigation menu. This takes you to your Documents library. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > When syncing files on your team site, you're syncing each file library on the site, not the entire site. 
  
    ![Team document library](../media/bd4bd33e-dee4-4f33-8eeb-ebf9462c89e2.png)
  
2. In the SharePoint, choose **Sync** to synchronize all the files. Or select the individual files you want to sync. 
    
    ![Document library with Sync button selected](../media/6ec1d32e-57a0-46b7-9f1c-6867f95e4586.png)
  
3. If prompted to switch apps, choose **Yes**. OneDrive for Business is the process doing the synchronization.
    ![Office 365 switch apps prompt](../media/fea88d3c-f6f5-4bb0-863b-1ddb9c630794.jpg)
  
4. If you then get a **Set up Onedrive** prompt to enter your Office 365 credentials, enter your Office 365 user ID and then your password. 
    
    ![OneDrive setup screen](../media/82cbb1ac-2ac5-42bd-82de-ba710bf46145.png)
  
5. At the **This is your OneDrive folder** screen, check the path under **Your OneDrive folder is here**. Choose **Change Location** if you want to use a different path, and then click **Next**. 
    
    ![Change your local folder at this screen](../media/6395485a-e729-4a9a-8e7d-b35e662435da.png)
  
6. When sync is finished, you see the files in your team's folder on your computer. Files that were on the team site, that have downloaded to your computer will have a cloud icon. Any files you add or update locally have a green check mark This indicates that they're up to date and synchronized with the library on the team site.
    
    ![See what's been sync'd in your local folder](../media/93e2ca9f-4b5b-4930-a94d-ebc5b95aca84.png)
  
7. Test the synchronization by opening a file in the team's folder on your computer. Make a change, and then choose **Save**.
    
    If you're connected to the Internet, you might see a notice indicating the file is being saved to your team site. It's also saved to your computer at the same time. If you get the message "Failed to upload," try again. Sometimes an inconsistent Internet connection can disrupt saving.
    
## Best practices for file storage and sharing
<a name="BKMK_WhatDif"> </a>

Here are a few tips for getting the most from OneDrive for Business or your Office 365 or SharePoint team site.
  
### File storage and collaboration recommendations for other types of small businesses

- **Small nonprofit**: Create an Office 365 team site to store shared documents so information is centrally located and archived. This way information isn't lost during personnel transitions. Create a private Office 365 team document library to store files that you want to keep private from the rest of the team, such as your personnel and financial documents. 
    
- **Sole proprietorships**: Use OneDrive for Business to store your own files and share them with customers on a case-by-case basis. 
    
- **Co-ownerships**: If you co-own the business, you can still use your OneDrive for Business, but you'll want to directly share your files with the other owner, and vice versa. 
    
- **Businesses with external clients or partners who need access to files**: Create a separate Office 365 group-connected team site to store and share documents intended for a specific customer. You can then associate it with your main site using [Create a hub site in SharePoint Online](https://support.office.com/article/92bea781-15d8-4bda-805c-e441e2191ff3). This site can be set to allow access specific to certain customers. You then don't need to worry that one customer will accidentally get access to information intended for another customer.
    
### Keep private files private

When you store a file in OneDrive for Business it's only accessible by you, unless you share it with others. When you share files, you can choose individual people to share with, or share with everyone. You can also create separate folders in OneDrive for different purposes such as public, personal, or for individual projects. Each folder can be shared with a different person or group, or nobody else at all.
  
For more information on sharing, also see [Video: Share files and folders in OneDrive for Business](https://support.office.com/article/72f26d6c-bf9e-432c-8b96-e3c2437f5b65).
  
### Track how much space you have left

To see how much storage space you have left in OneDrive for Business, see [Manage your OneDrive for Business storage](https://support.office.com/article/31519161-059C-4764-B6F8-F5CD29F7FE68).
  
### What files can be stored in OneDrive and a team Site?

While you can upload almost any format file, some files may not be allowed for two reasons: security and invalid characters in the file names. OneDrive for Business security policies block certain file types and a small set of characters. For more information on what file formats and invalid characters aren't allowed, see [Invalid file names and file types in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/64883A5D-228E-48F5-B3D2-EB39E07630FA).
