## Best Practices

When choosing custom colors, pick an **Accent color** that shows up well on a white or light background. The **Accent color** is used to color some links and buttons that show up on a white or light background. For example, the **Accent color** is used to color links in the app launcher. Additionally, the **Accent color** is used to color elements in a user's inbox and on their Office.com portal page. 
  
When choosing custom colors, pick a **Nav bar background color** and **Text and icons** color with a high contrast ratio to ensure that all text and icons are easily visible. 
  
The recommended contrast ratio between text, icon, or button color and background color is 4.5:1.
