## Customize your theme in the admin center

1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=402333) with your [work or school account](https://support.office.com/article/37da662b-5da6-4b56-a091-2731b2ecc8b4.aspx).

4. Next to **Manage custom themes for your organization**, click or tap **Edit**.

5. Change the theme elements you want for your organization:
    
  - **Logo image**: Choose whether to use an image from a URL or to upload an image. If you use a URL, please ensure that the URL uses HTTPS and is 200 x 30 pixels of any format of any size. You may upload a logo under 10 KB that is 200 x 30 pixels in JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG format .
    
  - **URL for a clickable logo**: You may use your logo in the navigation bar as a link to any company resource. You may enter the URL for the logo here, starting with http:// or https://. This is optional.
    
  - **Background image**: Select the image and upload your own JPG, PNG, or GIF with a resolution of 1366 x 50 pixels, no larger than 15 KB. The background image appears in the top navigation bar on every page.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Images that contain text may not display as expected. Built-in elements that appear on the right and left sides of the navigation bar can vary across services, and your text may be obscured by those elements. Due to the dynamic nature of the navigation bar, at this time we are unable to provide guidance for image padding that would result in a consistent experience. 
  
  - **Prevent users from overriding theme**: Flip this toggle to prevent users from choosing their own theme from our theme selection. This does not prevent users from being able to set a high contrast theme.
    
  - **Nav bar background color**: Select a color to use for the background of the navigation bar. The appears at the top on every page.
    
  - **Text and icons**: Select a color to use for the text and icons on the top navigation bar.
    
  - **Accent color**: Select a color to use for the navigation bar button hover color and page accents like buttons and text on certain applications.
      
  - **User name**: Choose whether to show a user's full name at the entry point to the account manager in the top right of the page when the user is signed in. By default, users will see their photo or their initials if a photo hasn't been uploaded.
    
6. Click or tap **Save**.
    
You'll see your new theme on the admin center right away and after a short delay, you'll see it throughout Office 365, including Outlook and SharePoint pages. You can remove your custom icon or custom colors at any time. Just return to the theme page and choose **Remove custom theming**
  
## Best Practices

When choosing a **Logo image**, we recommend using an SVG file type, wherever possible, so that your logo will have a high resolution appearance on all screens and at all zoom levels.

When choosing custom colors, choose a **Nav bar background color** that has a high contrast ratio with the **Logo image** that you picked. Also choose a **Text and icons** color with a high contrast ratio to the **Nav bar background color** to ensure that all text and icons are easily visible.

When choosing custom colors, pick an **Accent color** that shows up well on a white or light background. The **Accent color** is used to color some links and buttons that show up on a white or light background. For example, the **Accent color** is used to color elements in a user's inbox and on their Office.com portal page. 
  
The recommended contrast ratio between text, icon, or button color and background color is 4.5:1.
