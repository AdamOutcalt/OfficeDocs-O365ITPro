# Create distribution lists in the Office 365 admin center

 *Last updated 28 February, 2018* 
  
Used when you want to send email to group of people without having to type each individual recipient's name, distribution lists are organized by a particular discussion subject (such as "Marketing") or by users who share common work that requires them to communicate frequently. They also provide a way for you to automatically forward email to multiple email addresses.
  
Distribution lists are sometimes called distribution groups.
