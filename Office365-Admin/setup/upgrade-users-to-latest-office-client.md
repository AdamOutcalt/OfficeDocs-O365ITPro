# Upgrade your Office 365 for business users to the latest Office client

 **Is this the right topic for you?**
  
> If you use Office 365 for business in your organization and you're the person responsible for upgrading users to the latest version of Office, you're in the right place.
    
    If you're not an admin and you have an [Office for home](https://support.office.com/article/28cbc8cf-1332-4f04-9123-9b660abb629e.aspx#BKMK_OfficePlans) product, see [How do I upgrade Office](https://support.office.com/article/ee68f6cf-422f-464a-82ec-385f65391350.aspx) for information about upgrading your older, home use version of Office. 
    
## Getting ready to upgrade

As an Office 365 admin, you control what version of Office people in your organization can install. We highly recommend that you help users in your organization running older versions of Office such as Office 2007, Office 2010, Office 2013, or Office 2016 upgrade to the latest version to take advantage of its security and productivity improvements.
  
## Office 2007 reaches end-of-support

Office 2007 reached end-of-support on October 10, 2017, and anyone using Outlook 2007 in your organization can no longer connect to their Office 365 email as of Oct 31, 2017. To make sure you and your users can continue accessing email, you'll need to install an updated version of Office or access your email from a web browser only by signing in to **outlook.office365.com**. 
  
In addition, since February 28, 2017, users in your organization can no longer download and install Office 2013 themselves from the Office 365 software page. See [Office 2013 is no longer available for installation with an Office 365 subscription](https://support.office.com/article/de68fd95-553a-4c38-b1b5-e4205b96fc75.aspx).
  
> [!TIP]
> Check mainstream support end dates for all Office software at [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/selectindex). 
  
## Upgrade steps

The steps below will guide you through the process of upgrading your users to the latest Office desktop client. We recommend you read through these steps before beginning the upgrade process.
  
> [!NOTE]
> **For IT Professionals** IT Professional responsible for planning and testing **large scale deployments of Office in an enterprise** should also see [Office 2007 end of support roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/office-2007-end-support-roadmap). 
  
## Step 1 - Check system requirements

[Check the system requirements](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements) for Office to make sure your devices are compatible with Office 2016. For example, newer versions of Office can't be installed on computers running Windows XP or Windows Vista. 
  
> [!TIP]
> If your current install of Office is on a PC or laptop running an older versions of Windows and you want information about upgrading your operating system, see [Windows 10 system requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications). 
  
### Check application compatibility

To ensure a successful upgrade, we recommend identifying your Office applications--including VBA scripts, macros, third-party add-ins, and complex documents and spreadsheets--and assessing their compatibility with the latest version of Office.
  
For example, if you're using third-party add-ins with your current Office install, contact the manufacture to make sure they're compatible with the latest version of Office.
  
## Step 2 - Check your existing subscription plan

Some Office 365 plans don't include the full desktop versions of Office and the steps to upgrade are different if your plan doesn't include Office.

### Upgrade options for plans that don't include Office
<a name="BKMK_IncludesOffice"> </a>

> **Option 1 - Switch Office 365 subscriptions**
    
> Switch to a subscription that includes Office. See [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](../subscriptions-and-billing/switch-to-a-different-plan-0.md).
    
> **Option 2 - Buy individual, one-time purchases of Office, or buy Office through a volume license**

    - OR -
    
    - Buy multiple copies of Office through a volume license. See, [Compare suites available through volume licensing](https://products.office.com/business/microsoft-office-volume-licensing-suites-comparison).
    
## Step 3 - Uninstall Office
<a name="BKMK_Step3"> </a>

Before installing the latest version of Office, we recommend you uninstall all older versions of Office. However, if you change your mind about upgrading Office, note the following instances where you won't be able to reinstall Office after uninstalling it.
  
We recommend if you have third-party add-ins, contact the manufacturer to see if there's an update that will work with the latest version of Office.
  
### Known issues trying to reinstall older versions of Office after an uninstall

> **Office through a volume license** If you no longer have access to the source files of these volume license versions of Office, you won't be able to reinstall it. 
    
> **Office pre-installed on your computer** If you no longer have a disc or product key (if Office came with one) you won't be able to reinstall it. 
    
> **Non-supported Office 365 subscriptions** If your copy of Office was obtained through discontinued Office 365 subscriptions, such as Office 365 Small Business Premium or Office 365 Mid-size Business, you won't be able to install an older version of Office unless you have the product key that came with your subscription. 
    
If you'd prefer to install your older version of Office side-by-side with the latest version, you can see a list of versions where this is supported in, [Install and use different versions of Office on the same PC](https://support.office.com/article/6ebb44ce-18a3-43f9-a187-b78c513788bf.aspx). A side-by-side installation might be the right choice for you, if for example, you've installed third-party add-ins you're using with your older version of Office and you're not yet sure they're compatible with the latest version.
  
### Select the version of Office you want to uninstall

- [Office 2013 (from a PC)](https://support.office.com/article/9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8.aspx)
    
- [Office for Mac](https://support.office.com/article/eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3.aspx)
    
- [Office 2010](https://support.office.com/article/9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8.aspx#OfficeVerson=2010)

- [Office 2003](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971179)
    
## Step 4 - Assign Office licenses to users
<a name="BKMK_Step3"> </a>

If you haven't already done so, assign licenses to any users in your organization who need to install Office, see [Assign licenses to users in Office 365 for business](../subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users.md).
  
## Step 5 - Install Office
<a name="BKMK_Step3"> </a>

After you've verified the users you want to upgrade all have licenses, the final step is to have them install Office, see [Download and install or reinstall Office on your PC or Mac](https://support.office.com/article/4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658.aspx).
  
> [!TIP]
> If you don't want your users installing Office themselves, see [Manage software download settings in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/manage-software-download-settings-office-365). You can use the [Office Deployment Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-of-the-office-2016-deployment-tool) to download the Office software to your local network and then deploy Office by using the software deployment method you typically use.
