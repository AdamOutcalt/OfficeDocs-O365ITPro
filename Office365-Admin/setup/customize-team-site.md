# Customize your team site for file storage and sharing

If you have a small business with a few employees, one of the best ways to set up and facilitate file sharing and online collaboration is to use OneDrive and a SharePoint team site together. We recommend creating a team site that's connected to an Office 365 group. If you want to use chat, you can create this site by creating a team in Microsoft Teams. For more info about Teams, see [Video: What is Microsoft Teams?](https://support.office.com/article/b98d533f-118e-4bae-bf44-3df2470c2b12.aspx). If you don't want to use Teams, you can create a team site from the SharePoint start page.

Here are some ideas and links to help you customize, organize, and manage your team site. 
  
 
## Customize your team site

To give more visibility to data on a team site, you can customize the SharePoint start page to help you and your employees get to the information you need quickly. For example, you might have a links to employee OneDrive folders, and links to Documents, Contacts, Tasks, Calendars, and a OneNote notebook where you store meeting agendas and notes.
  
For info on customizing the look and feel of your start page, see [Change the look of your SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818.aspx).
  
Improve navigation on your site with [Customize the navigation on your SharePoint site](https://support.office.com/article/3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca.aspx).
  
To improve the discoverability of a site, add it as a featured link on the SharePoint start page. For info, see [Add featured links to the SharePoint start page](/sharepoint/change-links-list-on-sharepoint-home-page).
  
To add an image to a team site start page, see [Add a picture or image file to a SharePoint page](https://support.office.com/article/4A9B0E98-C89A-4A41-8ADB-B7750DCCCA16.aspx#ID0EAACAAA=SharePoint_Online).
  
To add pages to your site, see [Add a page to a site](https://support.office.com/article/b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec.aspx).
  
To learn about team site settings, see [Manage your SharePoint team site settings](https://support.office.com/article/8376034D-D0C7-446E-9178-6AB51C58DF42.aspx).
  
## Work with document libraries

A team site includes a document library that you can start using immediately. 

To begin uploading, see [Upload a folder or files to a document library](https://support.office.com/article/eb18fcba-c953-4d45-8d90-8da66edeacdb)

## Work with lists to organize data

SharePoint includes many templates for lists that you can add to your site, such as a list of links, a calendar, contacts, or tasks. 
  
Learn how to [Create a list in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/0D397414-D95F-41EB-ADDD-5E6EFF41B083.aspx#ID0EAAGAAA=Online).

If you're storing a lot of data in a list, see [Manage large lists and libraries in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/B8588DAE-9387-48C2-9248-C24122F07C59.aspx).

## Organize sites into hubs

Your team site shares almost everything with all members of the group associated with the site. If you want to have a separate site for specific customers, you can create additional team sites, and manage them using SharePoint hub sites. Here's more information. 
  
Hub sites let you add and associate sites. For more info see [What is a SharePoint hub site?](https://support.office.com/article/fe26ae84-14b7-45b6-a6d1-948b3966427f.aspx).
  
Ready to build a hub site, see [Create a hub site in SharePoint Online](/sharepoint/create-hub-site).
  
To learn how to add sites to a hub site, see [Associate a SharePoint site with a hub site](https://support.office.com/article/ae0009fd-af04-4d3d-917d-88edb43efc05.aspx).
  
## Sharing files with the team

While storage and organizing is a start, sharing with your team and external clients is also important. Here are some links to topics that will help you manage users and share your data. 
  
For file sharing with your team, see [Share SharePoint files or folders in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c.aspx).
  
To understand sharing outside your team, see [External sharing overview](/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview).
  
## Managing users and groups

As you manage your team site, you may have to add or remove users. Here's information to help you understand, add, and manage users on your team site.
