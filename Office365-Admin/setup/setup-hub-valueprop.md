# Optimize administration with the new Setup experience

Get the most out of the services you purchased and ensure your users are secure and productive with a new, proactive approach to onboarding and configuration. Whether you're a small business or a large enterprise, the Microsoft 365 Setup experience was designed for modern IT teams.

The new Setup experience boosts efficiency and optimizes onboarding experiences by eliminating the need to dig through disparate information to find what you need. Based on your admin role, Setup curates tasks and related information across the entire Microsoft 365 stack and then surfaces it in a single locationâ€”so you see only the tasks that matter to you.

## A single location to discover, learn, and take action

It can be a challenge for admins to discover the capabilities that are available across Microsoft 365, determine user impact, and then figure out how to enable those capabilities. The new Setup experience addresses this challenge by providing a common source for both learning and taking action.

Setup provides a logical grouping of tasks related to your admin function. Each task supplies at-a-glance information such as task description, user impact, prerequisites, effort to implement, and security and adoption statistics to help you understand consequences and impact before proceeding.

**Tim: Should we address scenarios or pivots here as a way of grouping? I'm not sure what's going to be available in March.**

## Focused learning, at your own pace

Besides curating tasks based on your admin role, Setup also curates information specific to each task. We've taken the guesswork out of determining what you need to know to confidently proceed. You get a consistent learning experience that helps you focus on relevant information and not waste time digging through extraneous documentation in multiple locations.

In addition to at-a-glance overview and impact information for each task, you'll find **Learn more** links for easy access to comprehensive articles. And since the collection of tasks are always visible, you can return to Setup at any time to deep dive and explore resources further.

## A clear path for taking action

Quickly setting up users so they can be productive is not easy. Onboarding experiences are often ambiguous&mdash;it's not always clear what your course of action should be or what the end goal is.

The new Setup experience optimizes onboarding by providing clarity on the end goal, information to help you make decisions, and clear next steps. When you're ready to take action on a task, just click **Get started** to launch a guided flow that will walk you through the task.

If you're multi-tasking, working on tasks over several days, or if there are multiple admins working on tasks, you can track completion by seeing at a glance which tasks have been completed and which ones still require attention. IT teams also benefit from built-in delegation, sharing, permissions, and collaboration.

## How does Setup work?

Info from Tim here. Talk about workflow of admins when they get to Setup. What do they see? How do we (Microsoft) identify what needs to be done so we can display appropriate tasks? How to they proceed? Talk about how pivots work (if they're in this release). Talk about how guided flows walk you through tasks when you click **Get started**. Etc.

## Setup showcase: multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps safeguard access to data and applications while maintaining simplicity for users. It provides additional security by requiring a second form of authentication and delivers strong authentication through a range of easy-to-use authentication methods, such as security questions and a password.

If you're a global admin **(Tim: Is this correct? How about other admins?)**, when you go to Setup you'll see a task for making sign-in more secure. **[Tim to add more detailed info about MFA functionality in the Setup hub.]**
