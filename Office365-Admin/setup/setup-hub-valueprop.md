# Optimize administration with the Setup hub

Get the most out of the services you purchased and ensure your users are secure and productive with a new, proactive approach to onboarding and administration task management. Whether you're a small business or a large enterprise, the Setup hub is built for modern IT teams. The Setup hub boosts efficiency and optimizes onboarding experiences by curating tasks and related information based on your admin role, and then surfaces it in a single location&mdash;so you see only the tasks that matter to you.

## What are the benefits of using the Setup hub?

The Setup hub eliminates the need to dig through disparate information to find what you need by providing a coordinated, compiled set of information and tasks that cross the entire Microsoft 365 stack.

### A single location to discover, learn, and take action

It can be a challenge for admins to discover the capabilities that are available across Microsoft 365, determine user impact, and then figure out how to enable those capabilities. The Setup hub addresses this challenge by providing a common source for both learning and taking action.

The Setup hub provides a logical grouping of tasks related to your admin function. If you're a billing admin, for example, you'll see only billing-related tasks. Each task supplies at-a-glance information such as task description, user impact, prerequisites, effort to implement, and security and adoption statistics to help you understand consequences and impact before proceeding.

**Tim: Should we address scenarios or pivots here as a way of grouping? I'm not sure what's going to be available in March.**

### Focused learning, at your own pace

Besides curating tasks based on your admin role, the Setup hub also curates information specific to each task. We've taken the guesswork out of figuring out what you need to know to confidently proceed. You get a consistent learning experience that helps you focus on relevant information and not waste time digging through extraneous documentation in multiple locations.

In addition to at-a-glance overview and impact information for each task, you'll find **Learn more** links for easy access to more comprehensive articles. And since the list of tasks are always visible, you can return to the Setup hub at any time to deep dive and explore resources further.

### A clear path for taking action

Quickly setting up users so they can be productive is not easy. Onboarding experiences are often ambiguous, and it's not always clear what your course of action should be or what the end goal is.

The Setup hub optimizes onboarding by providing clarity on the end goal, information to help you make decisions, and clear next steps. When you're ready to take action on a task, just click a **Get started** link to launch a guided flow that will walk you through the steps.

If you're multi-tasking, working on tasks over several days, or if there are multiple admins working on tasks, you can track completion by seeing at a glance which tasks have been completed and which tasks still require attention. IT teams also benefit from built-in delegation, sharing, permissions, and collaboration.

## How does the Setup hub work?

Info from Tim here. Talk about workflow of admins when they get to the Setup hub. What do they see? How do we (Microsoft) identify what needs to be done so we can display appropriate tasks? How to they proceed? Talk about how pivots work (if they're in this release). Talk about how guided flows walk you through tasks when you click **Get started**. Etc.

## Setup hub showcase: Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps safeguard access to data and applications while maintaining simplicity for users. It provides additional security by requiring a second form of authentication and delivers strong authentication through a range of easy-to-use authentication methods, such as security questions and a password.

If you're a global admin **(Tim: Is this correct? How about other admins?)**, when you access the Setup hub you'll see a task for making sign-in more secure. **[Tim to add more detailed info about MFA functionality in the Setup hub.]**
