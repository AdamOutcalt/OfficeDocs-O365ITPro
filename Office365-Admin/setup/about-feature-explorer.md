# Discover, learn, and take action with Feature explorer

Get the most out of the services you purchased and ensure your users are secure and productive with a new, proactive approach to administration task management. Whether you're a small or medium business or a large enterprise, Feature explorer is built for modern IT teams. Feature explorer boosts efficiency and optimizes onboarding experiences by curating tasks and related information based on your admin role, and then surfaces it in one location&mdash;so you see only the tasks that matter to you.

## What are the benefits? [Actual heading TBD]

Feature explorer eliminates the need to dig through disparate information to find what you need by providing a coordinated, compiled set of information and tasks that cross the entire Microsoft 365 stack.

Discover and learn about Microsoft 365 capabilities at your own pace, understand consequences and impact before taking action, and proceed with next steps when you're ready. Feature explorer also tracks task completion, so whenever you open Feature explorer you'll see at a glance which tasks have been completed and which tasks still require attention. IT teams also benefit from built-in delegation, sharing, permissions, and collaboration.
