# Change nameservers to set up Office 365 with Namecheap

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.md)** if you don't find what you're looking for.
  
Follow these instructions if you want Office 365 to manage your Office 365 DNS records for you. (If you prefer, you can [manage all your Office 365 DNS records at Namecheap](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md).)
  
    
## Add a TXT record for verification

1. To get started, go to your domains page at Namecheap by using [this link](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f). You'll be prompted to Sign in and Continue.
    
    ![Namecheap-BP-Configure-1-1](../media/1827f9fc-4dc9-4f9d-a392-7817c47b00b3.png)
  
2. On the **Landing** page, under **Account**, select **Domain List** from the drop-down list. 
    
    ![Namecheap-BP-Configure-1-2](../media/3f457d64-4589-422c-ae34-fc24b0e819eb.png)
  
3. On the **Domain List** page, find the name of the domain that you want to edit, and then choose **Manage**.
    
    ![Namecheap-BP-Configure-1-3](../media/fb2020d8-707c-4148-835e-304ac6244d66.png)
  
4. Choose **Advanced DNS**.
    
    ![Namecheap-BP-Configure-1-4](../media/05a4f0b9-1d27-448e-9954-2b23304c5f65.png)
  
5. In the **HOST RECORDS** section, choose **ADD NEW RECORD**.
    
    ![Namecheap-BP-Configure-1-5](../media/8849abfe-deb6-4f6a-b56d-e69be9a28b0f.png)
  
6. In the **Type** drop-down, select **TXT Record**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Type** drop-down automatically appears when you choose **ADD NEW RECORD**.
  
    ![Namecheap-BP-Verify-1-1](../media/a5b40973-19b5-4c32-8e1b-1521aa971836.png)
  
7. In the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table.
    
    (Select the **TTL** value from the drop-down list.) 
    
|**Type**|**Host**|**Value**|**TTL**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|TXT  <br/> |@  <br/> |MS=ms *XXXXXXXX*  <br/> **Note**: This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table in Office 365.           [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)          |30 min  <br/> |
   
   ![Namecheap-BP-Verify-1-2](../media/fe75c0fd-f85c-4bef-8068-edaf9779b7f1.png)
  
8. Choose the **Save Changes** (check mark) control. 
    
    ![Namecheap-BP-Verify-1-3](../media/b48d2c67-66b5-4aa4-8e59-0c764f236fac.png)
  
9. Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.
    
Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Office 365 and request Office 365 to look for the record.
  
When Office 365 finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.
  
1. Choose **Setup** \> **Domains**.
    
2. On the **Domains** page, choose the domain that you are verifying. 
    
    ![Domain name selected in Microsoft 365 admin center](../media/c61204f1-a025-448b-a2a1-c4d7abee7a06.png)
  
3. On the **Setup** page, choose **Start setup**.
    
    ![Start setup](../media/5f6578af-ae32-49e8-b283-ec2d080420da.png)
  
4. On the **Verify domain** page, choose **Verify**.
    
    ![Verify](../media/c256ab1d-03f2-498e-bb63-19e4d49a6b97.png)
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md). 
  
## Change your domain's nameserver (NS) records

To complete setting up your domain with Office 365, you change your domain's NS records at your domain registrar to point to the Office 365 primary and secondary name servers. This sets up Office 365 to update the domain's DNS records for you. We'll add all records so that email, Skype for Business Online, and your public website work with your domain, and you'll be all set.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> When you change your domain's NS records to point to the Office 365 name servers, all the services that are currently associated with your domain are affected. For example, all email sent to your domain (like rob@ *your_domain*  .com) will start coming to Office 365 after you make this change. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When you have completed the steps in this section, the  *only*  nameservers that should be listed are these four: >  ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com >  ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com >  ns3.bdm.microsoftonline.com >  ns4.bdm.microsoftonline.com >  The following procedure will show you how to delete any other, unwanted nameservers from the list, and also how to add the  *correct*  nameservers if they are not already in the list. 
  
1. To get started, go to your domains page at Namecheap by using [this link](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f). You'll be prompted to Sign in and Continue.

### If there ARE nameservers already listed

> [!CAUTION]
> Follow these steps  *only*  if you have existing nameservers other than the four  *correct*  nameservers. (That is, delete  *only*  any current nameservers that are  *not*  named **ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com**, **ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com**, **ns3.bdm.microsoftonline.com**, or **ns4.bdm.microsoftonline.com**.)
