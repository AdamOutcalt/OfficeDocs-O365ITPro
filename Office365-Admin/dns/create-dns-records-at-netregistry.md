# Create DNS records at Netregistry for Office 365

[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.md) if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
If Netregistry is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.
  
These are the main records to add.
  
- [Add a TXT record for verification](#add-a-txt-record-for-verification)
    
- [Add an MX record so email for your domain will come to Office 365](#add-an-mx-record-so-email-for-your-domain-will-come-to-office-365)

- [Add the CNAME records that are required for Office 365](#add-the-cname-records-that-are-required-for-office-365)
    
- [Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam](#add-a-txt-record-for-spf-to-help-prevent-email-spam)
    
- [Add the two SRV records that are required for Office 365](#add-the-two-srv-records-that-are-required-for-office-365)
    
After you add these records at Netregistry, your domain will be set up to work with Office 365 services.
  
To learn about webhosting and DNS for websites with Office 365, see [Use a public website with Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/a8178510-501d-4bd8-9921-b04f2e9517a5.aspx).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Troubleshoot issues after changing your domain name or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md). 
  
## Add a TXT record for verification
<a name="bkmk_txt"> </a>

Before you use your domain with Office 365, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Office 365 that you own the domain.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like. 
  
1. To get started, go to your domains page in Netregistry by using [this link](https://theconsole.netregistry.com.au/). You'll be prompted to log in.
    
    ![Netregistry_login](../media/ed3c785f-01c3-49e7-affd-c04637c0ffe9.png)
  
2. Next to the domain you want to manage, select **Manage**.
    
    ![Netregistry_Manage](../media/64ad542a-5ec4-4148-96f8-d6e163449352.png)
  
3. Select **Zone Manager**.
    
    ![Netregistry_selectZoneManager](../media/e18c32f9-c1e7-4aa2-9aa6-8dc9c5ea44af.png)
  
4. Under ﻿ **﻿Add a zone record**,﻿ choose **TXT Record** from the list, and then select **Create new record**.
    
    ![Netregistry_TXT_select](../media/eb1761e6-9deb-4631-8deb-bc5d09926722.png)
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > You must use quotation marks before and after the entry in the TXT box. 
  
    In the **New TXT Record** form, type or copy and paste the values from the following table. 
    
    |**Name**|**TTL (SEC)**|**TXT (Points to address or value)**|
    |:-----|:-----|:-----|
    |(leave blank)  <br/> |3600 (seconds)  <br/> |"MS=msXXXXXXXX"  <br/> **Note:** This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table in Office 365. [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)  |
       
    ![Netregistry_verificationTXTvalues](../media/cfe8b05a-fa8b-4dba-9554-7a3466e6c012.png)
  
6. Choose **Add record**.
    
Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Office 365 and request Office 365 to look for the record.
  
When Office 365 finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.
  
1. Choose **Setup** \> **Domains**.
    
2. On the **Domains** page, choose the domain that you are verifying. 
    
    ![Domain name selected in Microsoft 365 admin center](../media/c61204f1-a025-448b-a2a1-c4d7abee7a06.png)
  
3. On the **Setup** page, choose **Start setup**.
    
    ![Start setup](../media/5f6578af-ae32-49e8-b283-ec2d080420da.png)
  
4. On the **Verify domain** page, choose **Verify**.

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam
<a name="bkmk_spf"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Office 365. Instead, add the required Office 365 values to the current record so that you have a  *single*  SPF record that includes both sets of values.
  
1. To get started, go to your domains page in Netregistry by using [this link](https://theconsole.netregistry.com.au/). You'll be prompted to log in.
