# Create DNS records at Hostgator for Office 365

 **[Check the Domains FAQ](../setup/domains-faq.md)** if you don't find what you're looking for. 
  
If Hostgator is your DNS hosting provider, follow the steps in this article to verify your domain and set up DNS records for email, Skype for Business Online, and so on.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must perform the first procedure in the following list, [Point your domain to your hosting account](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_PointDomain), before you add DNS records by using any of the other procedures in this article. > (Need more help? [Still need help?](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_NeedHelp).) 
  
- [Point your domain to your hosting account](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_PointDomain)
    
- [Add a TXT record for verification](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_verify)
    
- [Add an MX record so email for your domain will come to Office 365](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_add_MX)
    
- [Add the six CNAME records that are required for Office 365](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_add_CNAME)
    
- [Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_add_TXT)
    
- [Add the two SRV records that are required for Office 365](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_add_SRV)
    
After you make all of these changes at Hostgator, your domain will be set up to work with Office 365 services.
  
To learn about webhosting and DNS for websites with Office 365, see [Use a public website with Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/a8178510-501d-4bd8-9921-b04f2e9517a5.aspx).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records in Office 365](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md). 
  
## Point your domain to your hosting account
<a name="BKMK_PointDomain"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must perform this procedure before you perform any of the other procedures in this article. 
  
Follow these steps to associate your domain and hosting accounts.
  
1. To get started, go to your domain management page at Hostgator by using [this link](https://register.hostgator.com/?manage). You'll be prompted to log in.
    
    ![Hostgator-BP-Redelegate-1-0](../media/6749ac23-4832-4daf-8f3b-bc3b9b1b979c.png)
  
2. Choose **Manage Domains**.
    
    ![Hostgator-BP-Redelegate-1-1](../media/56d12bfd-3549-4033-90dc-077c76ca798c.png)
  
3. On the **Manage Domains** page, in the **My Domains** area, choose the domain you want to update. 
    
    ![Hostgator-BP-Redelegate-1-3](../media/c8979d8a-ee96-4064-a8df-c5b01054cb16.png)
  
4. Choose **Name Servers**.
    
    ![Hostgator-BP-Redelegate-1-4](../media/4cf61060-1e8a-4758-9892-32059ffc90c2.png)
  
5. On the **Name Servers** page for your domain, in the **To point this domain to an existing host account** drop-down list, select the **hosting account** that is associated with your domain. 
    
    ![Hostgator-BP-Redelegate-1-5](../media/5b73ae32-f26e-48aa-b5ad-6da20f1c491a.png)
  
6. Choose **Save Name Servers**.
    
    ![Hostgator-BP-Redelegate-1-9](../media/b52a825a-6d54-49ba-87c8-52f770fdfa0c.png)
  
## Add a TXT record for verification
<a name="BKMK_verify"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you perform this procedure, you must first perform the procedure in the first section of this article, [Point your domain to your hosting account](create-dns-records-at-hostgator.md#BKMK_PointDomain). 
  
Before you use your domain with Office 365, we have to make sure that you own it. Your ability to log in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Office 365 that you own the domain.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This record is used only to verify that you own your domain; it doesn't affect anything else. You can delete it later, if you like. 
  
1. To get started, go to your cPanel page at Hostgator. You'll be prompted to log in first.
    
    (Each hosted account at Hostgator is assigned a unique cPanel address. Your cPanel address should look like this: https://YourSiteAddress:secure-port-number. The sign-up email you received from Hostgator will specify that address.)
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To have a cPanel associated with your domain, you need a hosting account with Hostgator. To get started with Office 365, you can either purchase a hosting account from Hostgator or [redelegate your nameservers to point to Office 365](change-nameservers-at-hostgator.md). 
  
2. On the **Control Panel** page, in the **Domains** area, choose **Advanced DNS Zone Editor**.
    
3. On the **Advanced DNS Zone Editor** page, in the ** Add a Record ** area, in the boxes for the new record, type or copy and paste the values from the following table. 
    
    (Select the **Type** value from the drop-down list.) 
    
|||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Name** <br/> |**TTL** <br/> |**Type** <br/> |**TXT Data** <br/> |
|Use your  *domain_name*  . (for example, fourthcoffee.com.)  <br/> **This value MUST end with a period (.)** <br/> |1  <br/> |TXT  <br/> |MS=ms *XXXXXXXX*  <br/> > [!NOTE]> This is an example. Use your specific **Destination or Points to Address** value here, from the table in Office 365. [How do I find this?](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md)          |
   
4. Choose **Add Record**.
    
5. Wait a few minutes before you continue, so that the record you just created can update across the Internet.
    
Now that you've added the record at your domain registrar's site, you'll go back to Office 365 and request Office 365 to look for the record.
  
When Office 365 finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.
  
1. In the Office 365 admin center, choose **Setup** \> **Domains**.
    
2. On the **Domains** page, choose the domain that you are verifying. 
    
3. On the **Setup** page, choose **Start setup**.
    
4. On the **Verify domain** page, choose **Verify**.
    
> [!NOTE]
> Typically it takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a change you've made to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records in Office 365](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).

## Add a TXT record for SPF to help prevent email spam
<a name="BKMK_add_TXT"> </a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot have more than one TXT record for SPF for a domain. If your domain has more than one SPF record, you'll get email errors, as well as delivery and spam classification issues. If you already have an SPF record for your domain, don't create a new one for Office 365. Instead, add the required Office 365 values to the current record so that you have a single SPF record that includes both sets of values. Need examples? Check out these [External Domain Name System records for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/c0531a6f-9e25-4f2d-ad0e-a70bfef09ac0#bkmk_spfrecords). To validate your SPF record, you can use one of these [SPF validation tools](../setup/domains-faq.md).
