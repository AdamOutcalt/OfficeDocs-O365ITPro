# Create an Office 365 group in the Microsoft 365 admin center
  
While users can create an Office 365 group from Outlook or other apps, as an admin, you may need to create or delete groups, add or remove members, and customize how they work. The Microsoft 365 admin center is the place to do this. 

> [!TIP]
> Office 365 connected Yammer groups must be created in Yammer, but can be managed in the Microsoft 365 admin center like other Office 365 groups. To learn more, see [Yammer and Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/article/d8c239dc-a48b-47ab-b85e-6b4b8191a869.aspx). 

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not using the new Microsoft 365 admin center, you can turn it on by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page.

### Send copies of conversations to group members' inboxes
  
When you use the admin center to create a group, by default users  do not get copies of group emails and meeting invitations sent to their inboxes. They'll need to go to the group to see conversations and meetings. You can change this setting in the admin center.

When you turn this setting on, group members will get a copy of group emails and meeting invitations sent to their Outlook Inbox. They can read and delete this copy of the email and not affect anyone else. In the Group inbox, a copy of the email still exists.

Group members can opt out of receiving these emails by choosing to stop following the group in Outlook.

2. On the **Settings** tab, select **Send copies of group conversations and events to group members** if you want members to receive copies of group messages and calendar items in their own inbox.

3. Select **Save**.

## Who can delete email from the Group Inbox?

The Group owner can delete any emails from the Group Inbox, regardless of whether they were the initial author.
  
A member can delete an email conversation from the Group Inbox if they initiated it, and only using Outlook on the web (right-click the email, then choose **Delete**). They can't do it from the Outlook app (Outlook 2016).
  
When an email is deleted from the group mailbox, it is not deleted from any of the group members' personal mailboxes.
