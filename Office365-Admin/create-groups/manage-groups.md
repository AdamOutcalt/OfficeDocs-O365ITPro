# Manage an Office 365 group in the Microsoft 365 admin center

After you have [created an Office 365 group](create-groups.md) and added group members, you can configure your group. You can edit the group name, description, or email aliases, manage owners or members, specify whether external senders can email the group and whether to send copies of group conversations to members. 

## Edit a group name


## Edit a group description


## Change a group email alias


## Manage group owners


## Manage group members


## Send copies of conversations to group members' inboxes
  
When you use the admin center to create a group, by default users  do not get copies of group emails and meeting invitations sent to their inboxes. They'll need to go to the group to see conversations and meetings. You can change this setting in the admin center.

When you turn this setting on, group members will get a copy of group emails and meeting invitations sent to their Outlook Inbox. They can read and delete this copy of the email and not affect anyone else. In the Group inbox, a copy of the email still exists.

Group members can opt out of receiving these emails by choosing to stop following the group in Outlook.
