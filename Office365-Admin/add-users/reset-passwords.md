# Reset Office 365 business passwords

  
## Let users reset their own passwords

We strongly recommend that you set up self-service password reset. This way you don't have to manually reset passwords for your users. To learn how, see [Let users reset their own passwords in Office 365](let-users-reset-passwords.md).
  
## Reset an Office 365 business password for someone else

These steps are only for people using an Office 365 business plan. To do them, you need to sign in with your Office 365 admin account. [What's an admin account?](../admin-overview/admin-overview.md)

## Reset my Office 365 tenant admin password

Use these steps if you forgot your password but you're able to sign in to Office 365 because, for example, your password is saved in your browser: 
    
1. In Office 365, select **Settings** \> **Office 365** \> **Personal info**. 
          
2. Double-check that your **Contact details** and **Alternate email** are accurate. If not, change them now. 
        
3. Sign out of Office 365: select your name in the upper right corner (in the above image, shown as **Diane**) \> **Sign out**. 
        
4. Now sign in again: type your user name \> **Next** \> and then select **Forgot password**. 
    
5. Follow the steps in the wizard to reset your password. It uses your alternate contact info to verify you're the right person to reset your password. 
    
If you forgot your password and can't sign in: 
    
- Ask another global admin in your business to reset your password for you.
    
- Or, [call Microsoft Support](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/contact-support-for-business-products-admin-help-32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#ID0EAADAAA=Phone_support_). 
    
## Reset all Office 365 business passwords for everyone in your organization at the same time

These steps work for a business with tens of users. If you have hundreds or thousands of users, see the next section on resetting passwords in bulk.
  
1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.
    
2. Select the option next to **Display name** to select everyone in your business. Then unselect yourself. You can't reset your own password at the same time you reset everyone else's password.
    
3. Select **Reset password**. 

4. Follow the instructions on the **Reset password** page, and select **Reset**.  If you opted for auto-generating the passwords, the new temporary passwords will be displayed.   
    
5. Enter an email address where you can receive the temporary passwords. You'll need to notify your users what their temporary passwords are.
