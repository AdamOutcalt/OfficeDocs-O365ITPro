# Resend a user's password in Office 365 - Admin Help

This article explains how to resend the notification email to a new user in Office 365. You do this by resetting the user's password.
  
You must be an [global admin or password administrator](about-admin-roles.md) to perform these steps. 
  
    
1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.
     
2. On the **Active users** page, choose the user and then choose **Reset password**.
    
3. Follow the instructions on the **Reset password** page to auto-generate a new password for the user or create one for them, and then select **Reset**.  
    
4. Enter an email address the user can get to so they receive the new password, and follow up with them to make sure they got it.
