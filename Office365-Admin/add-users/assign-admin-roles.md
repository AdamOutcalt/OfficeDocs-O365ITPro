# Assign admin roles in Office 365 for business
 
As the person who purchased your Office 365 business subscription, you are the global administrator. This means you have complete control over the Office 365 suite of products. To help you manage Office 365 for your business, you can assign users to administrator roles so they can perform tasks in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For example, if you want help resetting passwords, you can assign someone to the Password administrator role.

## Assign admin roles to a user in your business

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"
1.  In the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-germany"

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** > [Active users](https://portal.office.de/adminportal/home) page.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="o365-21vianet"

1.In the admin center, go to the **Users** > [Active users](https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn) page.

::: moniker-end

2. On the **Active users** page, choose the user whose administrator role you want to change, and then choose **Manage roles**. 
    
    If you don't see the **Manage roles** option, then you don't have global admin permissions and can't assign admin roles to other people. Ask a global admin in your business to assign roles for you. In a small business, the business owner (the person who purchased Office 365) is a global admin. In a large business, key people in the IT department are global admins.

3. Choose **Customized administrator** to see a list of roles we've customized for you. For a description of each role, see [About Office 365 admin roles.](about-admin-roles.md)
    
    
## Assign admin roles to multiple users


If you know PowerShell, see [Assign roles to user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854257). It's ideal for assigning roles to hundreds of users.
  
Use the following instructions to assign roles to tens of users.

3. Choose the roles you want to assign, and the click **Save**.
    
## Didn't work for you?


Here is the top issue customers encounter when assigning admin roles:
  
- You are not part of the global admin group and so you don't have permissions to assign admin roles to other users. Ask another admin to assign roles for you.
