# Setting up Organization Directory

Kaizala organization admins can define and manage user attributes for an organization. They can add custom user attributes (employee ID, manager, etc) in the Kaizala Management Portal, which makes it easier for admin(s) and other users to identify a user.

Organization Admin(s) can add new attributes and define settings that each attribute can have.
  
## Set up attributes for all users in the organization

- Click or tap **Directory** \> **More**. Then select **Manage Attributes** from the drop-down menu. 
    
- To add a new attribute, select **Add New**. Then choose from a range of pre-defined suggested attributes or add a new one. 
    
For a new attribute, you can enter the name of the attribute, select its type (string, number, Yes/No and date/time) and whether values for this attribute is required or not. For each attribute following property needs to be set:
 
 | | | Default value | Behavior|
 |:--:  |:------------:|:------:|:-------:|
    | Allow users to edit values for themselves | ON | If set ON, then users themselves and Tenant Admin(s) can edit values for the attributes. If set OFF, only Tenant admin(s) can edit values |
    | Show this column to all users | ON | If set ON, this particular column is visible to all users. Else, this is visible only to Tenant admin(s) ||
    
  - You can add multiple attributes at once
  - Once you've finalized the list of attributes, click **Save** to add the new changes to the organization's attribute list
