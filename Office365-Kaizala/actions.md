# Kaizala Actions

Kaizala Action is a 'unit of work' that helps users get work done within a conversation context, inside Kaizala. Some of these Actions like Jobs, Surveys, and Polls are shipped out-of-the-box, and provide scoped functionality. Once you publish an Action, users can find it in the Kaizala app, and then they can be used in a conversation context from the Action Palette.
  
You can design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface within the Kaizala management portal. This can be done by building on the out-of-the-box Survey Action.
  
## Create Kaizala Action

1. To create a new Kaizala Action, navigate to **Actions** from the left navigation bar. Select **New Action** from the top right of the page. 
    
2. Click on one of the available templates:
    
    a.  **New Form** - Use this template to collect data in a form, from your group members. The form can be filled at any time.
    
    b.  **New Survey** - Use this template to request data from group members. This is done by creating a Survey Action with pre-filled questions. You can send this Action via the app at regular intervals.
    
    c.  **Feedback** - Use this template to collect any type of feedback from a group.
    
    d.  **Announcement** - Use this template to make key announcements and share updates to a group.
    
3. Fill out the information on the page and click or tap **Next**.

## Add Kaizala Action to a group

You can publish a Kaizala Action to one or more groups. When you do so, all the group members will start seeing the action in the Discover tab of the Kaizala phone app. The action only appears to users who are members of the group you selected.
  
In case of a group having a managed Action palette, added Actions will be visible directly in the group's Action palette.
  
To add a Kaizala Action to a group:
  
1. Select the selected group from the **Groups** page. 
    
2. Navigate to the **Action** tab. Click or tap **Add Action.**

1. Select the group for which you want the action to be removed, from the Groups page.
    
2. Navigate to the Action Tab. Find the Action that you want to remove.
    
3. Click or tap ( **...** ). Finally, click **Remove**. 
    
## Activate or deactivate a Kaizala Action

Once you deactivate a Kaizala Action, it won't be available for publishing to any new groups. The action will however continue to work for existing groups. An action can be removed from a group without being re-activated. However, once it has been removed, it can't be re-published to the same group, unless it is re-activated.
  
## Remove Kaizala Action

You can remove a Kaizala Action from the Actions list by selecting **Remove**. Removing an Action will unpublish it from all the groups, to which it was published.
