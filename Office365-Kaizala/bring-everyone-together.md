# Bring everyone together with Kaizala

With Microsoft Kaizala you can bring your unconnected workforce and partners into your organization’s directory with phone numbers and key attributes. Empower each employee to be able to search and connect with anyone within the organization.

First, to get the organization’s directory in place, you will need to:

- [Create the company phonebook](#create-the-company-phonebook) – With Kaizala you can digitize your company’s entire phone directory with phone numbers and key attributes about all your employees and value chain networks. Also, empower each employee to be able to search and connect with anyone within your organization.
- **Invite people to install Kaizala** – Evangelize Kaizala in your organization to positively influence people to install Kaizala.

## Create the company phonebook

Add users your organization's Kaizala phonebook. These users can be employees, vendors, suppliers, or partners across the value chain. There is no need for these users to have an organization email ID. 

You can create the company phonebook with Kaizala in two easy steps:

### Step 1 – Collect phone numbers and user info

- Begin to collect user information for all the users you need to add to your organization’s Kaizala phonebook.
- All you need is a phone number - and some key fields that make it easy to recognize the user (such as name, email, organization, location, and so on). While phone number is a required field, the other attributes are not. Decide which key user attributes you would need in your phone directory. 

### Step 2 – Import to Kaizala to prepare the phonebook

1. On the Kaizala Management portal, select the **Groups** menu on the left menu panel.
2. Select **Add users in Bulk**.
3. Select **Add users to Phonebook**.
4. Download the User upload CSV template. Prepare the template with details of the users (phone number and user attributes) to upload to Kaizala phonebook.
   - **User CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the users' phone numbers, and user details. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. This file is mandatory and must be uploaded before proceeding to the next step.
