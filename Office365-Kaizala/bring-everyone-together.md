# Bring everyone together with Kaizala

Microsoft Kaizala brings together employees and external partners into a single directory using phone numbers and other key attributes. Kaizala empowers each employee to search and connect with anyone across the organization.

To get the organization’s directory in place, you need to:

- [Create the company phonebook](#create-the-company-phonebook) – With Kaizala, you can digitize your organization’s entire phone directory across your entire value chain.
- [Invite people to install Kaizala](#invite-people-to-install-kaizala) – Promote Kaizala at your organization to encourage adoption.

## Create the company phonebook

Kaizala users can be anyone associated with your organization, including employees, contractors, vendors, suppliers, or other partners. There’s no need for these users to have an organization email ID. 

You can create the company phonebook with Kaizala in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Collect phone numbers and user info

Collect user information for everyone you want to add to your Kaizala phonebook.

- The most important piece of information you need is a phone number. This is a required field.
- Other key pieces of information make it easy to find people (such as name, email, organization, location, and so on). These are optional fields. 

### Step 2 – Import to Kaizala to prepare the phonebook

1. On the Kaizala management portal, select the **Groups** menu on the left menu panel.
2. Select **Add users in Bulk**.
3. Select **Add users to Phonebook**.
4. Download the User upload CSV template. Prepare the template with phone numbers and user attributes.
   - **User CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the users' phone numbers, and user details. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. You must upload a CSV file before the next step.

5. Find the prepared CSV file, and select **Upload**.
6. Your users are now uploaded. 

## Invite people to install Kaizala

You can invite people to install Kaizala in three easy steps.

### Step 1 – Send SMS invitations to install Kaizala

You can quickly send an invitation to anyone not using Kaizala. Simply click or tap **Invite** to send a text message invitation to install Kaizala.

### Step 2 – Communicate through existing digital channels

Now that the company phonebook is in Kaizala, it’s time to invite everyone to install Kaizala.

- Create awareness and motivate people to adopt Kaizala through digital channels, such as:
  - Your existing consumer app groups
  - Company intranet
  - Company email
- Start by sending out Kaizala posters to help people learn about Kaizala, and why they should start using it.
