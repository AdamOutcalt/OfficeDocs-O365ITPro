# URLs and address ranges for Kaizala

Microsoft Kaizala requires connectivity to the internet. Organizations, if required by firewall protections, must allow certain IP addresses and URLs to enable their users to access the Kaizala app and its services.

> [!NOTE]
> - Endpoint data is updated with new IP addresses and URLs published 30 days in advance of being active.
> - Endpoint data might also be updated if needed to address support escalations, security incidents, or other immediate operational requirements.

The following table shows endpoint URLs and IP address ranges required for connectivity from a userâ€™s device to Kaizala and related services. It does not include network connections from Microsoft into a customer network, sometimes called hybrid or inbound network connections.
