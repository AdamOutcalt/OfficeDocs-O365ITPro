# Chat history in Kaizala

Have you ever wanted your group members to view earlier sent messages, even if they were not a group member yet? This might be true when you want to keep all your announcements, memos, and surveys visible to every member at any point of time.

Kaizala lets you do that. The chat history feature in Kaizala enables admins to let older messages be visible to new group members whenever they join.

## Enable group chat history

Group admins can enable chat history both from the Kaizala management portal and the Kaizala app.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, chat history is enabled for all groups in Kaizala.

> [!NOTE]
> Only messages sent after enabling this policy will be visible to new users.

### Enable chat history using the Kaizala app

1. Open the Kaizala app.
2. Tap the group for which you want chat history to be enabled.
3. Tap the group name on the top bar. The **Group settings** page will open.
4. Tap the **More** icon (...) on top-right of the window. Tap **Enable chat history**.
5. In the dialog pop-up window, tap **Enable**.

### Enable chat history using the Kaizala management portal

1. Log in to the [Kaizala management portal](http://manage.kaiza.la) using your Office 365 school or work account.
2. Select the **Groups** tab on the left.
3. Select the group from the group list for which you want chat history to be enabled.
4. Select the **More** icon (...) next to the group name.
5. Select **Edit Policies**. The **Group Policy** dialog box opens.
6. Select the check box for chat history.
7. Select **Save**.

For private groups, messages are saved only for a maximum period of 45 days. For organizational groups, messages are saved for an unlimited period of time. In 1-1 chats, chat history cannot be enabled. 

## User experience

If the chat history feature is turned on for a group, chats start getting saved in Kaizala. This enables new group members to view saved messages that were sent even when they hadn't joined the group.

When a new user joins a group that has chat history enabled, the user can view 10 older messages by default. If a user wants to view more older messages, the user needs to scroll up at the top of chat canvas to load more messages. Currently every time a user scrolls at the top of chat canvas, 20 more old messages are downloaded for view.

## Disable group chat history

Group admins can disable chat history both from the Kaizala management portal and the Kaizala app.

> [!NOTE]
> Once chat history is disabled, it stops showing older messages to new users.
