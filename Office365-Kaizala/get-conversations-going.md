# Get conversations going with Kaizala

Your workforce in the office and in the field needs to communicate and coordinate to get work done. Often this communication happens over unsecured personal messaging apps – putting your organization’s data security at risk. 

Use Microsoft Kaizala to “secure chat” and enable your organization to connect and coordinate across the value chain while retaining complete ownership of work-related chat data. Connect your organization in Kaizala groups that mirror your way of working. 

To engage your workforce and value chain, set up company connect groups:

- Move work chats from consumer apps to Kaizala 
- Create groups to mirror your working style
- Invite others to chat securely
