# Get conversations going with Kaizala

Your workforce in the office and in the field needs to communicate and coordinate to get work done. Often this communication happens over unsecured personal messaging apps, putting your organization’s data security at risk. 

Use Microsoft Kaizala to “secure chat” and enable your organization to connect and coordinate across the value chain while retaining complete ownership of work-related chat data. Connect your organization in Kaizala groups that mirror your way of working. 

To engage your workforce and value chain, set up company connect groups:

- [Move your existing groups to Kaizala](#move-your-existing-groups-to-kaizala)
- [Create work groups to meaningfully connect your organization](#create-work-groups-to-meaningfully-connect-your-organization)
- [Invite others to chat securely](#invite-others-to-chat-securely)

## Move your existing groups to Kaizala

Replicate groups that currently exist on unsecure consumer chat apps to Kaizala secure work-related chat. Ensure a seamless transition experience for users so they adopt Kaizala and influence their peers positively to join the change. 

You can move conversations to Kaizala in three easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create a group on Kaizala 

1. Tap **Chats** > **New Group**.
2. Enter a name for your group, and then tap **Next**.
3. Tap **Done** to create your group.

> Personalize your groups by using your group photographs for group icon.

### Step 2 – Invite others

1. From the **Chats** list, open the group.
2. Tap on the group name to open the **Group Info** page.
3. On the **Group Info** page, tap **Invite People**.
4. Tap **Share** to send the link to existing groups on consumer messaging apps.

> [!NOTE]

> [!TIP]
> Share these posters and training materials in the consumer messaging apps groups to educate users about this change and accelerate adoption.

### Step 3 – Map your group to the organization 

You’ll need to link this group to your organization to ensure data security and to make sure all group data stays with the organization.

1. Tap on the group name to open the **Group** Info page.
2. Tap **More** on the upper right of the Group Info page.
3. Tap **Add to organization**. Once mapping is done, you will be alerted with a prompt.

## Create work groups to meaningfully connect your organization

Use Kaizala to meaningfully connect your organization in groups that are mirrored around the way your organization works. For example, Contoso Corp could have several groups, such as 
Contoso – All Employees, Contoso - Finance , Contoso – Sales , Contoso - Sales (East),  and so on.

Use the Kaizala management portal to manage your groups centrally and to add or manage users in bulk (even in thousands) while retaining complete control over chat data. 

You can connect users across your organization in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create groups (bulk upload users from management portal)

1. On the Kaizala management portal, from the left navigation bar, select **Groups**.
2. Select **Create Group**, enter the group name, and then click or tap **Create**.

#### If number of users to be added are few 

The operation can be done manually on the Kaizala management portal using the **Users** tab.

1. On the **Users** tab, make sure the phone numbers are from the correct region.
2. Enter a phone number in the text box for every user you want to add to this Kaizala group. You can also enter a list of comma-separated phone numbers.
3. Finally, click or tap **Add users**. For example, to add three users, enter: 99885544, 99885543, 99885542.

#### Add multiple user phone numbers to a Kaizala group using bulk upload

If you want to add several users without using the comma separated list, you can do so using bulk upload. This requires preparing a User Group Mapping CSV file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> IT help might be required. Consider contacting your organization IT admins to help with these steps.

**User Group Mapping CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the group name, users' phone numbers, and user type. You can add multiple groups at a time. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. This file is mandatory and must be uploaded before proceeding to the next step.

You can add multiple groups and users at once from an Excel spreadsheet or other file saved in CSV format.

1. Click or tap **Groups**, and then click or tap **Bulk Upload Users**.
2. On the **Bulk Upload Users** page, download the User Group Mapping CSV template file. Follow the steps to add your groups and user phone numbers. If you want to define group hierarchy, download and use the Parent Group Mapping CSV template file. Save the file to a location that you'll remember.
3. On the **Bulk Upload Users** page, select the file you saved previously, and select **Upload**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If there are problems with the file, they are displayed in the panel. Select the job time stamp link to see the detailed logs.

4. If there aren't any problems with the file, click **Upload** to upload your groups and users' info.

### Step 2 – Onboard group admins/champs who will drive and curate group

For every group that you decide to create, you should identify admins or champs who will manage the group and be the group steward.
 
Key responsibilities of the group admin or champ are:

- **User engagement** – share training and how-to materials.
- **Content moderation** – share and implement guidelines on appropriate usage. 
- **Helping users** –  with how to perform queries.
- **User management** – remove or add users. 

Your corporate communication team or senior team members are most likely to fit these roles.

Here are some guidelines for admins or champs.
