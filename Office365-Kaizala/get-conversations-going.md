# Get conversations going with Kaizala

Your workforce in the office and in the field needs to communicate and coordinate to get work done. Often this communication happens over unsecured personal messaging apps – putting your organization’s data security at risk. 

Use Microsoft Kaizala to “secure chat” and enable your organization to connect and coordinate across the value chain while retaining complete ownership of work-related chat data. Connect your organization in Kaizala groups that mirror your way of working. 

To engage your workforce and value chain, set up company connect groups:

- Move your existing groups to Kaizala
- Create work groups to meaningfully connect your organization
- Invite others to chat securely

## Move your existing groups to Kaizala

Replicate groups that currently exist on unsecure consumer chat apps to Kaizala secure work-related chat. Ensure a seamless transition experience for users so they adopt Kaizala and influence their peers positively to join the change. 

You can move conversations to Kaizala in three easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create a group on Kaizala 

1. Tap **Chats** > **New Group**.
2. Enter a name for your group, and then tap **Next**.
3. Tap **Done** to create your group.

### Step 3 – Map your group to the organization 

You’ll need to link this group to your organization to ensure data security and to make sure all group data stays with the organization.
