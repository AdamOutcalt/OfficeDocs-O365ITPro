# Get conversations going with Kaizala

People in the office and in the field need to communicate to get work done. This often happens over unsecured personal messaging apps, putting your organization’s data at risk.

Microsoft Kaizala enables your organization to coordinate across the value chain while retaining complete ownership and security of work-related chat data. Connect your organization in Kaizala groups that mirror your way of working.

To engage your workforce, set up company connect groups in three phases:

- [Move your existing groups to Kaizala](#move-your-existing-groups-to-kaizala)
- [Create work groups to meaningfully connect your organization](#create-work-groups-to-meaningfully-connect-your-organization)
- [Invite others to chat securely](#invite-others-to-chat-securely)

## Move your existing groups to Kaizala

The first step is to replicate groups that currently exist on unsecure consumer chat apps on Kaizala. This ensures a seamless transition for users to adopt Kaizala and get other people to join the new platform.

You can move conversations to Kaizala in three easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create a group on Kaizala 

1. Tap **Chats** > **New Group**.
2. Enter a name for your group, and then tap **Next**.
3. Tap **Done** to create your group.

> Personalize your groups by using your group photographs for group icon.

### Step 2 – Invite others

1. From the **Chats** list, open the group.
2. Tap on the group name to open the **Group Info** page.
3. On the **Group Info** page, tap **Invite People**.
4. Tap **Share** to send the link to existing groups on other messaging apps.

> Anyone who receives the link can join the group. 

> [!TIP]
> Share these posters and training materials in other messaging apps (**NEED LINK HERE**) to inform people of this change and accelerate adoption.

### Step 3 – Map your group to the organization 

You must link your new group to your organization to ensure data security and to ensure all data stay with the organization.

1. Tap on the group name to open the **Group** Info page.
2. Tap **More** on the upper right of the Group Info page.
3. Tap **Add to organization**. Once mapping is done, you will see a prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not already signed in to Kaizala with your Office 365 email ID, you will get a prompt to sign in at this step. Simply sign in with your Office 365 email ID and proceed to map the group.

## Create work groups to meaningfully connect your organization

Use Kaizala to create groups that reflect how your organization works. For example, Contoso Corp could have several groups, such as Contoso – All Employees, Contoso - Finance, Contoso – Sales, Contoso - Sales (East), and so on.

The Kaizala management portal is a centralized location to manage groups and add or manage users in bulk while retaining complete control over chat data.

You can connect users across your organization in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create groups (bulk upload users from management portal)

1. On the Kaizala management portal, from the left navigation bar, select **Groups**.
2. Select **Create Group**, enter the group name, and then click or tap **Create**.

#### If you only have a few users to add 

You can manually add users on the Kaizala management portal through the **Users** tab.

1. On the **Users** tab, make sure the phone numbers are from the correct region.
2. Enter a phone number in the text box for every user you want to add to the group. You can also enter a list of comma-separated phone numbers.
3. Finally, click or tap **Add users**. For example, to add three users, enter: 99885544, 99885543, 99885542.

#### If you have many users to add

If you want to add several users without using the comma separated list, you can use bulk upload. This requires preparing a User Group Mapping CSV file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might need help from someone in IT. Consider contacting your organization IT admins for these steps.

**User Group Mapping CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the group name, user phone numbers, and user type. You can add multiple groups at a time. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. You must upload a CSV file before the next step.

You can add multiple groups and users at once from an Excel spreadsheet or other file saved in CSV format.

1. Click or tap **Groups**, and then click or tap **Bulk Upload Users**.
2. On the **Bulk Upload Users** page, download the User Group Mapping CSV template file. Follow the steps to add groups and user phone numbers. If you want to define a group hierarchy, download and use the Parent Group Mapping CSV template file. Save the file to a location that you'll remember.
3. On the **Bulk Upload Users** page, select the file you saved previously, and select **Upload**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Any problems with the file are displayed in the panel. Select the job time stamp link to see the detailed logs.

4. If there aren't any problems with the file, select **Upload**.

### Step 2 – Onboard group admins/champs who will drive and curate group

For every group that you decide to create, you should identify admins or champs who will manage the group and be the group steward.
 
Key responsibilities of the group admin or champ are:

- **User engagement** – share training and how-to materials.
- **Content moderation** – share and implement guidelines on appropriate usage. 
- **Helping users** –  show people how to perform queries and other things.
- **User management** – remove or add users. 

Your corporate communications team or senior team members are ideal for these roles.

Here are some guidelines for admins or champs. (**NEED LINK HERE**)
