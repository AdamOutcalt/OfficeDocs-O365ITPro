# Create discussion groups in Kaizala

Use Kaizala to create groups that reflect how your organization works. For example, Contoso Corp could have several groups, such as Contoso – All Employees, Contoso - Finance, Contoso – Sales, Contoso - Sales (East), and so on.

The Kaizala management portal is a centralized location to manage groups and add or manage users in bulk while retaining complete control over chat data.

You can connect users across your organization in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create groups (bulk upload users from management portal)

1. On the Kaizala management portal, from the left navigation bar, select **Groups**.
2. Select **Create Group**, enter the group name, and then click or tap **Create**.

#### If you only have a few users to add 

You can manually add users on the Kaizala management portal through the **Users** tab.

1. On the **Users** tab, make sure the phone numbers are from the correct region.
2. Enter a phone number in the text box for every user you want to add to the group. You can also enter a list of comma-separated phone numbers.
3. Finally, click or tap **Add users**. For example, to add three users, enter: 99885544, 99885543, 99885542.

#### If you have many users to add

If you want to add several users without using the comma separated list, you can use bulk upload. This requires preparing a User Group Mapping CSV file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might need help from someone in IT. Consider contacting your organization IT admins for these steps.

**User Group Mapping CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the group name, user phone numbers, and user type. You can add multiple groups at a time. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. You must upload a CSV file before the next step.

You can add multiple groups and users at once from an Excel spreadsheet or other file saved in CSV format.

1. Click or tap **Groups**, and then click or tap **Bulk Upload Users**.
2. On the **Bulk Upload Users** page, download the User Group Mapping CSV template file. Follow the steps to add groups and user phone numbers. If you want to define a group hierarchy, download and use the Parent Group Mapping CSV template file. Save the file to a location that you'll remember.
3. On the **Bulk Upload Users** page, select the file you saved previously, and select **Upload**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Any problems with the file are displayed in the panel. Select the job time stamp link to see the detailed logs.

4. If there aren't any problems with the file, select **Upload**.

### Step 2 – Onboard group admins/champs who will drive and curate group

For every group that you decide to create, you should identify admins or champs who will manage the group and be the group steward.
 
Key responsibilities of the group admin or champ are:

- **User engagement** – share training and how-to materials.
- **Content moderation** – share and implement guidelines on appropriate usage. 
- **Helping users** –  show people how to perform queries and other things.
- **User management** – remove or add users. 

Your corporate communications team or senior team members are ideal for these roles.

Here are some guidelines for admins or champs. (**NEED LINK HERE**)
