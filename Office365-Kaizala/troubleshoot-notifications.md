1. Go to **Settings** \> **Advanced Settings** on your Android device. 
    
2. Tap the **Battery** option and then tap **Protected apps**.
    
3. Go to Kaizala and select the option to protect it.
    
 **You'll also need to change an option in your Android 6.0 version and later.**
  
1. Go to **Settings** and open the apps section. Then go to ** Advanced **.
    
2. Go to **Ignore Battery Optimizations**.
    
3. Go to **Kaizala** and select the option to protect it. 
    
 **For Android versions before 6.0, you'll also need to change a few settings.**
  
1. Go to **Settings** \> **Battery**.
    
2. Go to Kaizala and turn off **Freeze in background** \> **Automatically optimise when an abnormality is detected**.
    
Now allow notifications.
  
1. Go to **Settings** \> ** notification panel &amp; status bar ** \> **Notifications**.
