# Digitize everyday tasks with Kaizala

Microsoft Kaizala comes with a bunch of out-of-the-box Kaizala Action cards which can help effectively manage work. For example:
- Use Kaizala surveys to collect field data such as daily sales data, audit reports, and so on.
- Use Kaizala Action cards like attendance and polls anytime, anywhere.
- Use the Kaizala job card and checklist to assign and follow up on tasks remotely.

Kaizala forms and surveys are a great way to efficiently collect data from your mobile workforce. The collected data automatically gets aggregated and reports are made available for in-depth analysis. They are great for enabling scenarios like daily sales data collection, conduct audits, solicit ideas, and so on.
