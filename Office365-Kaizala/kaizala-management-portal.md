# Kaizala management portal

Microsoft Kaizala is a secure chat and messaging app that enables mobile users to send instant messages, Kaizala Actions, attachments such as pictures, documents, videos, audios and more. Microsoft Kaizala also lets you get instant feedback from your users about anything you want. With Kaizala Actions, you can send out polls and surveys to a few users or thousands, and once they respond, all responses are automatically aggregated and presented in an easy to view report, to help with decision making.
  
[Download Kaizala for your mobile phone](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=851074), and learn about how to use the mobile app here: [About the Kaizala mobile app](kaizala-mobile-app.md).

## Kaizala management portal

The Kaizala management portal is a web based portal that provides management, reporting and extensibility capabilities for Kaizala. With the Kaizala management portal, your organization can quickly onboard thousands or millions of users to Kaizala, including employees, partners, vendors, or customers, with just phone number. You can create Kaizala groups and add users, and also view out-of-the-box reports for Kaizala Actions such as Jobs and Surveys. You need to have a Kaizala subscription before you can use Kaizala. First step login with your Azure Active Directory account. After successful login add your Kaizala registered phone number. Once your phone number is authenticated, you can manage Kaizala features.
  
The Kaizala management portal can be used by the following users:
  
- **IT administrators** -- Use to set up groups and manage users within these groups in a secure and compliant manner. For example, an administrator can add or remove users from a specific group, or remove a user from all organization groups, so that when an employee leaves, the person doesn't remain a member of organization groups, and doesn't have access to organization data. 
    
- **Developers** -- Use to either create a new Kaizala Action or customize a Kaizala Action. Developers can also add a new connector to integrate their internal or external systems with Kaizala. 
    
- **Business User** -- Use to view built-in reports, with real-time data updates, for Kaizala Actions shared in organization groups.
