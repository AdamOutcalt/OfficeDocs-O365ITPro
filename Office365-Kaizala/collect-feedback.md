# Collect feedback with Kaizala

The company connect group is also a convenient mobile channel to collect feedback on relevant issues, decisions, and policies, especially for remote workers.

You can gather feedback from employees, partners, suppliers, and customers through feedback forms, polls, and surveys. All responses are automatically aggregated to give you insights into the responses. 

You can collect feedback through the company connect group in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Collect employee feedback 

To collect feedback, design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface within the Kaizala management portal. 

1. Log on to the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la/).
2. Create a Kaizala Action: Go to **Actions** from the left navigation bar, and select **New Action** from the upper-right of the page.
3. Select the Feedback template for the new action. 
4. Fill out the name and description, and then tap **Next**.
5. As you prefer, customize the Response View, Immersive View, and Chat view. (Add questions and answer options and set a custom format.) 

   **Example of Response View**

   **Example of Chat View**

6. After you are done, tap **Submit**. Users will now be able to see the details page of the new action. 
7. At this moment, the action is in draft state.
8. You need to publish the action. To publish an action:
   - When your action is successfully uploaded, it is available in draft state.
   - You need to stage the uploaded version in order to [test and debug](https://docs.microsoft.com/kaizala/actions/test) your action.
   - After you have tested your action, you can activate the action. The action moves to the active state.
   - Read more about the [lifecycle of a Kaizala Action](https://docs.microsoft.com/kaizala/actions/actionlifecycle).

### Step 2 – Onboard communications team to analyze feedback

Make sure your organization corporate communications team or relevant other team is onboarded to the group as an *admin*.

This will allow the admins to perform various roles such as:

- **Content curation** – share timely surveys for feedback collection.
- **Content moderation** – share and implement guidelines on appropriate usage. 
- **Helping users** – with how to perform queries.

Your corporate communications team or senior team members are most likely to fit these roles.

Here are some guidelines for admins or champs. (**NEED LINK HERE**)
