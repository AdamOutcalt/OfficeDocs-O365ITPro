# Create the company phone directory for Kaizala

Kaizala users can be anyone associated with your organization, including employees, contractors, vendors, suppliers, or other partners. There’s no need for these users to have an organization email ID. 

You can create the company phonebook with Kaizala in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Export contact list from your existing systems

Collect user information for everyone you want to add to your Kaizala phonebook.

- The most important piece of information you need is a phone number. This is a required field.
- Other key pieces of information make it easy to find people (such as name, email, organization, location, and so on). These are optional fields. 

### Step 2 \– Import to Kaizala to prepare the phone directory

1. On the Kaizala management portal, select the **Groups** menu on the left menu panel.
2. Select **Add users in Bulk**.
3. Select **Add users to Phonebook**.
4. Download the User upload CSV template. Prepare the template with phone numbers and user attributes.
   - **User CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the users' phone numbers, and user details. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. You must upload a CSV file before the next step.
