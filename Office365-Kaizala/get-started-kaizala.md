# Get started with Kaizala

Microsoft Kaizala makes it easy to connect and coordinate work with task workers, vendors, distributors, partners, and customers using a simple chat interface. Kaizala consists of the Kaizala app and the Kaizala management portal.

- The **Kaizala app** is a secure mobile app that lets users communicate and collaborate with others in and outside of your organization.
- The **Kaizala management portal** is a web-based management portal that provides management, reporting, and extensibility capabilities for Kaizala.

## Enable the Kaizala license

The Kaizala Pro license allows every Office 365 user to have access to the Kaizala management portal and to link their mobile app to their Office account.

See [Enable or disable Kaizala Pro for your organization](enable-disable-kaizala.md).

## Create Kaizala users

Before users can send instant messages, pictures, and documents, or setup a new poll or survey, you have to create Kaizala users in the Kaizala management portal.

See [Create Kaizala users](users.md).
