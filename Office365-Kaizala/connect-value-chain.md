# Connect your value chain in Kaizala

Microsoft Kaizala enables you to create company connect groups to establish a mobile communication channel with your entire mobile workforce, partners, and customers.

You can use these groups to:

- Share corporate communications on policy, initiatives, and announcements.
- Conduct required workforce trainings and conduct surveys.
- Collect feedback from employees, partners, and customers.

Engage your workforce by creating a company connect hub with Kaizala:

- [Conduct trainings on Kaizala](#conduct-trainings-on-kaizala)
- [Collect employee feedback with Kaizala](#collect-employee-feedback-with-kaizala)

## Create company connect groups

Setting up a company connect group essentially involves setting up a one-way communication channel between the organization and the workforce. This allows the organization to broadcast important announcements and updates and information with the workforce.

In Kaizala, a company connect can be set up by following these easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create a hub and spoke group
 
A hub and spoke group in Kaizala is a unique group where members of the group can interact with the admin of the group on a one-to-one basis, but the interactions cannot be seen by other group members. 

> [!NOTE]
> Hub and spoke groups can only be created on the Kaizala management portal. 

Key characteristics of a hub and spoke group:

- Admin can connect with any number of members and send and seek information.
- Members cannot see each other or interact with each other.
- Members can communicate with admins only through admin-defined custom cards such as giving feedback, share your requirement, and so on.
- Members can subscribe to a public group using a link.
- Group can either be managed (group admins can view, manage, and invite subscribers) or public (subscribers can invite other subscribers; group admins cannot view or manage subscribers).

To create a hub and spoke group:

1. On the Kaizala management portal, from the left navigation bar, choose **Groups**.
2. Select **Create Group**, from the drop-down menu, select **Public Group**.

   ![Screenshot of Create a public group window](media/create-public-group.png)

3. Enter the group name, short description, and long description for your company connect group. 
4. If you'd like, enter a welcome message, which subscribers will get once they join the group.
5. Choose between two group types: **Managed** or **Public**.
   - **Managed** group type allows the group admins to view, manage, and invite subscribers.
   - **Public** group type allows subscribers to also invite other subscribers. Group admins cannot view or manage subscribers.
6. If only a few users need to be added, consider adding them manually through the **Users** tab.
7. On the **Users** tab, make sure the phone numbers are from the correct region. Enter a phone number in the text box for every user you want to add to this Kaizala group. You can also enter a list of comma-separated phone numbers. Finally, click or tap Add users. For example, to add three users, enter: 99885544, 99885543, 99885542.

   ![Screenshot of Add Users window](media/add-users.png)

### Step 2 – Add your employees to the group


If you want to add several users without using the comma separated list, you can do so using bulk upload.

**User Group Mapping CSV** – Use this CSV template file to enter the group name, users' phone numbers, and user type. You can add multiple groups at a time. The CSV template file contains relevant instructions and examples. Read the instructions carefully before filling and uploading the file. This file is mandatory and must be uploaded before proceeding to the next step.

![Screenshot of Import Multiple Users window](media/import-multiple-users.png)

You can add multiple groups and users at once from an Excel spreadsheet or other file saved in CSV format.

- Click or tap **Groups**, and then click or tap **Bulk Upload Users**.

### Step 3 – Onboard the content moderation team

For the company connect group created in step 1, identify admins or champs who will manage the content on the group and moderate it. 

Key responsibilities of the group admin or champ are:

- **User engagement** – share training and how-to materials.
- **Content moderation** – share and implement guidelines on appropriate usage. 
- **Helping users** –  with how to perform queries.
- **User management** – remove or add users. 

Your corporate communications team or senior team members are most likely to fit these roles.

Here are some guidelines for admins or champs. (**NEED LINK HERE**)

> [!TIP]
> Set up RSS feeds for drawing in organization related content from across channels such as social media, websites, and blogs, to have them show up in the group automatically. Follow [these steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/kaizala/businesssolutions/corporatecommunications/getrssfeedsonkaizala/displayrssfeedsinkaizalagroups).

## Conduct trainings on Kaizala

The company connect group serves as a great channel to share employee trainings, especially for workforce performing in unstructured mobile-only environments. (Think about your field sales agents, or your front-line workforce.)
Kaizala not only allows you to share important trainings to be shared with employees, but also helps you track training completion in the workforce and send reminders to people yet to complete the trainings. 

You can conduct trainings through the company connect group in three easy steps.

### Step 1 – Create and share trainings 

To conduct trainings with Kaizala, you’ll need to add the Training “Action card” to your company connect group you just created. 

The Kaizala training card lets you send training content along with training questions or quizzes to your team. Reports for the trainings are available on the Kaizala management portal.

![Screenshot of Kaizala training card](media/training-card.png)

You can set up training on Kaizala quickly if training content and questions are ready.

To add Kaizala training card to a company connect group:

To access the Training Action Card:
1.	In the group conversation, in the chat box at the bottom of the page, tap the paperclip icon.
2.	The available actions are listed in the first row. 
3.	To discover more actions:
    - Tap **Add More** at the upper right. 
    - Or, tap **Discover** > **Kaizala Actions** to access a full list of available actions.
4. Tap the Training Action Card to add to your palette, and then tap **Add to chats**.
5. On adding the training card to the group, use the card to set up training (assuming you have training content ready). 
6. In the group conversation, in the chat box at the bottom of the page, tap the paperclip icon.
7. Click on the training card option, and then proceed to enter training details such as title and description and add a cover image. 

   ![Screenshot of Training Details window](media/training-details.png) 

8. Use the **Add content** button to enter training content such as images, text documents, and video on the Kaizala training card. (Use the **Add Questions** button to enter questions with selectable answer options; this can be used to test knowledge.)
9. When all the training content and the knowledge test questions are added to the training card, select **Next**.
10. Enter training options such as training expiry, results visibility options, attempts, and so on.

    ![Screenshot of Training Options window](media/training-options.png)
 
11. When the training options have been set, you’re all set to share the training with the people in the company connect group.

### Step 2 – Send reminders to defaulters

With Kaizala, you can help people stay on tracking by sending them reminders for completing the training within deadlines.
 
To send a reminder:

1. Tap the published action in your conversation.
2. Tap **Remind people to respond** at the bottom of the page.

### Step 3 – Report to track completion and performance

Group admins can use the Kaizala action card to check how many people have taken this training. 
 
To check reports on training:

1. Tap the training action card in the group chat window. 
2. Tap **Insights** to see how many people have finished the training.

## Collect employee feedback with Kaizala

The company connect group also serves as a convenient mobile channel to collect feedback on relevant issues, decisions, and policies, especially for workforce preforming in mobile-only unstructured environments.

Kaizala allows for collection of feedback from employees, partners, suppliers, and customers through feedback forms, polls, and surveys. All responses are automatically aggregated to enable you to draw insights based on responses collected. 

You can collect feedback through the company connect group in two easy steps.

### Step 1 – Collect employee feedback 

To collect feedback, you can design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface within the Kaizala management portal. 

1. Log on to the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la/).
2. Create a Kaizala Action: Go to **Actions** from the left navigation bar, and select **New Action** from the upper-right of the page.
3. Select the Feedback template for the new action. 
4. Fill out feedback action card name and description, and the tap **Next**.
5. Do relevant customizations on Response View, Immersive View, and Chat view. (Add questions and answer options and format.) 

   **Example of Response View**

   ![Screenshot of feedback card in response view](media/response-view.png)

   **Example of Immersive View**

   ![Screenshot of feedback card in immersive view](media/immersive-view.png)

   **Example of Chat View**

   ![Screenshot of feedback card in chat view](media/chat-view.png)

6. After you are done, tap **Submit**. Users will now be able to see the details page of the new action. 
7. At this moment, the action is in draft state.
8. You need to publish the action. To publish an action:
   - When your action is successfully uploaded, it is available in draft state.
   - You need to stage the uploaded version in order to [test and debug](https://docs.microsoft.com/kaizala/actions/test) your action.
   - After you have tested your action, you can activate the action. The action moves to the active state.
   - Read more about the [lifecycle of a Kaizala Action](https://docs.microsoft.com/kaizala/actions/actionlifecycle).

### Step 2 – Onboard communications team to analyze feedback

Make sure your organization corporate communications team or relevant other team is onboarded to the group as an *admin*.

This will allow the admins to perform various roles such as:

- **Content curation** – share timely surveys for feedback collection.
- **Content moderation** – share and implement guidelines on appropriate usage. 
- **Helping users** – with how to perform queries.

Your corporate communications team or senior team members are most likely to fit these roles.

Here are some guidelines for admins or champs. (**NEED LINK HERE**)
